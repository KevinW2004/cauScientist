Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, and including this edge would better align the graph with domain knowledge and potentially improve the log-likelihood by capturing a more accurate causal mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - smoke -> bronc\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - either -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 2):\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20100.311722043993\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

The tentative notes suggest that these edges may be indirect or mediated by other variables, such as 'either'. To improve the graph, we consider deleting these edges and verifying their absence through targeted interventional experiments. If the effect of the parent on the child disappears when the intermediate variable is controlled, the edge is likely indirect and can be removed. This approach aligns with causal inference principles, particularly the backdoor and frontdoor criteria, and ensures the graph remains a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: tub \u2192 xray (Reasoning: The tentative notes suggest that the edge 'tub \u2192 xray' may be indirect, possibly mediated through 'either'. If this is the case, the direct edge should be deleted to better represent the true causal structure.)\n2. DELETE: lung \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Similar to the 'tub \u2192 xray' relationship, 'lung \u2192 xray' may be mediated by 'either'. Removing this edge would align the graph with the hypothesis that 'either' is the true mediator of x-ray outcomes.)\n3. DELETE: bronc \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: The tentative notes indicate that the effect of 'bronc' on 'dysp' may be indirect and mediated through 'either'. If this is confirmed, the direct edge 'bronc \u2192 dysp' can be deleted to refine the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['tub', 'bronc', 'xray', 'dysp'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

First, the direct edges from 'tub' and 'lung' to 'xray' are questioned, as marginal evidence suggests an ancestral relationship, but conditional evidence implies indirect paths. Second, the edge from 'bronc' to 'dysp' is suspected to be redundant due to mediation through 'either'. These changes are prioritized to align the graph with interventional and conditional evidence. Experiments are designed to test the directness of these relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: tub \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Conditional evidence suggests the relationship from 'tub' to 'xray' may be indirect, possibly mediated through 'either'. Removing this edge would test whether the influence of 'tub' on 'xray' is indeed through 'either' rather than a direct path.)\n2. DELETE: lung \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Similar to the 'tub' case, marginal evidence supports a potential ancestral relationship from 'lung' to 'xray', but conditional evidence suggests it may be indirect. Removing this edge would help determine if the effect is mediated through 'either' or other variables.)\n3. DELETE: bronc \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: Interventional evidence suggests the effect of 'bronc' on 'dysp' is indirect, possibly mediated through 'either'. Removing this edge would test if 'either' fully accounts for the relationship between 'bronc' and 'dysp', making the direct edge redundant.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['tub', 'bronc', 'xray', 'dysp'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: bronc\u2192dysp\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

The tentative addition of 'either \u2192 dysp' was based on interventional evidence that do(either) affects dysp. However, this relationship may not be directly causal, as dyspnea (dysp) could be influenced by bronchitis (bronc) and lung disease (lung) independently of 'either'. To refine the graph, we consider three candidate operations: (1) deleting 'either \u2192 dysp' if it is not a direct cause, (2) adding 'lung \u2192 xray' if lung disease directly affects x-ray results, and (3) adding 'tub \u2192 xray' if tuberculosis directly affects x-ray outcomes. These changes are motivated by the need to align the graph with domain knowledge and experimental evidence.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - lung \u2192 either\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: either \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: The relationship 'either \u2192 dysp' is tentative and may be a spurious association. Dyspnea can be directly caused by lung disease or bronchitis, not necessarily by the disjunction of either. Removing this edge could improve the graph's accuracy.)\n2. ADD: lung \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Lung disease (lung) can directly affect x-ray results. Including this edge would better reflect the direct causal pathway from lung disease to x-ray findings.)\n3. ADD: tub \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Tuberculosis (tub) is a known cause of abnormal x-ray results. Including this direct edge would align the graph with clinical knowledge and improve its representational accuracy.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['asia', 'tub'], do(smoke) affects lung (avg_TVD=0.0038).

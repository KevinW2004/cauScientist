The tentative notes suggest that the links 'smoke \u2192 lung', 'smoke \u2192 bronc', and 'asia \u2192 tub' may be indirect or non-existent. This implies that these edges may need to be deleted from the graph. Additionally, the current graph lacks a direct link from 'smoke' to 'lung' and 'smoke' to 'bronc', which are commonly assumed in the Asia domain due to smoking being a known risk factor for both lung disease and bronchitis. Thus, we propose to investigate these relationships further through targeted experiments.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: smoke \u2192 lung (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests no significant effect of do(smoke) on lung, which implies that the direct causal link from 'smoke' to 'lung' may be non-existent or indirect. This relationship is commonly assumed in the Asia domain, so verifying it is critical.)\n2. DELETE: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests no significant effect of do(smoke) on bronc, indicating that the direct causal link from 'smoke' to 'bronc' may be non-existent or indirect. This relationship is also commonly assumed in the Asia domain, so verification is necessary.)\n3. DELETE: asia \u2192 tub (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates no significant effect of do(asia) on tub, suggesting that the direct causal link from 'asia' to 'tub' may be non-existent or indirect. This is an important link in the Asia domain, and its absence needs to be confirmed.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'bronc'], do(smoke) affects lung (avg_TVD=0.0077). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'lung'], do(smoke) affects bronc (avg_TVD=0.0150). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['lung', 'bronc'], do(asia) affects tub (avg_TVD=0.0473). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['tub', 'bronc', 'asia']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects lung (TVD=0.0055). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'lung', 'asia'], do(smoke) affects bronc (avg_TVD=0.0048). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['smoke', 'lung', 'bronc'], do(asia) affects tub (avg_TVD=0.0240).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

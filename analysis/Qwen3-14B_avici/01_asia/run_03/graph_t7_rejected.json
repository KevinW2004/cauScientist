Based on domain knowledge and the structure of the Asia DAG, the following candidate changes are proposed:\n\n1. **Add an edge from 'smoke' to 'lung'**: Smoking is a well-known cause of lung cancer, and this relationship is critical in the Asia domain. The current graph does not include this edge, which may lead to incorrect inferences about the causes of lung disease.\n\n2. **Add an edge from 'smoke' to 'bronc'**: Smoking is also a known cause of bronchitis, and this relationship is likely missing in the current graph.\n\n3. **Reverse the edge from 'either' to 'dysp'**: The 'either' variable is a logical OR of 'tub' and 'lung', and while it may influence 'dysp' indirectly, the direct causal effect of 'either' on 'dysp' may be spurious. It is more plausible that 'tub' or 'lung' directly influence 'dysp', or that 'bronc' has a direct effect, which is already included.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed as follows.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - tub \u2192 either\n  - lung \u2192 either\n  - either \u2192 xray\n  - bronc \u2192 dysp\n  - either \u2192 dysp\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: smoke \u2192 lung (Reasoning: Smoking is a known direct cause of lung disease, and including this edge improves the accuracy of the causal model.)\n2. ADD: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: Smoking is a known direct cause of bronchitis, and this relationship is important for modeling the causal pathways in the Asia domain.)\n3. REVERSE: dysp \u2192 either (Reasoning: The current edge 'either \u2192 dysp' may be spurious. Dyspnea (shortness of breath) is more likely caused by underlying conditions like tuberculosis or lung disease, not by the logical OR of these conditions.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'bronc'], do(smoke) affects lung (avg_TVD=0.0077).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

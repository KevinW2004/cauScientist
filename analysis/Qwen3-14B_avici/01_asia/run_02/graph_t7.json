However, based on domain knowledge and logical reasoning, there are potential improvements to consider. First, the variable 'smoke' is a known risk factor for 'lung' and 'tub' (tuberculosis), yet it is not connected in the current graph. Second, 'bronc' (bronchitis) is often caused by smoking, which is not currently represented. Third, 'asia' (a binary variable indicating whether a person is of Asian descent) is likely to be a risk factor for 'tub', but this connection is not present. These three relationships\u2014smoke \u2192 lung, smoke \u2192 bronc, and asia \u2192 tub\u2014are strong candidates for addition to the graph. To verify these, targeted interventional experiments can be designed.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - either -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: smoke \u2192 lung (Reasoning: Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, and this relationship is well-established in medical literature. Adding this edge would better represent the causal influence of smoking on lung disease.)\n2. ADD: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: Smoking is a common cause of bronchitis. Including this edge would improve the model's accuracy in representing the causal pathways leading to bronchitis.)\n3. ADD: asia \u2192 tub (Reasoning: Individuals of Asian descent are at higher risk for tuberculosis due to genetic and environmental factors. Including this edge would better capture the causal influence of 'asia' on 'tub'.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['asia'], do(smoke) affects tub (avg_TVD=0.0036).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

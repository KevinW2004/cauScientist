For the candidate operation 'DELETE: tub \u2192 either', the evidence shows that do(tub) affects xray significantly even when conditioning on 'either' (avg_TVD=0.0155), which suggests that the effect of 'tub' on 'xray' is not fully mediated through 'either'. This implies that 'tub' may have a direct effect on 'xray', making the indirect path through 'either' unnecessary. However, the marginal evidence also supports the ancestral relationship between 'tub' and 'xray', so we must be cautious about removing the 'tub \u2192 either' edge unless we are certain that the effect is fully direct. The other candidates (adding tub \u2192 dysp and bronc \u2192 xray) are not supported by significant interventional effects, so we do not consider them at this time.

However, the tentative note indicates that marginal evidence supports 'tub' as an ancestor of 'xray', raising the possibility of a direct causal relationship. To resolve this ambiguity, we should test whether 'tub' directly influences 'xray' or if the effect is entirely mediated through 'either'.\n\nAdditionally, the graph does not include a direct path from 'tub' to 'dysp', even though 'tub' influences 'either', and 'either' influences 'dysp'. This raises the question of whether 'tub' has a direct effect on 'dysp' as well. Similarly, 'bronc' influences 'dysp', but we do not know if it influences 'xray' directly or only through 'either'. These relationships warrant investigation to ensure the graph is both minimal and accurate.\n\nBased on this, three candidate operations are proposed: removing the indirect path from 'tub' to 'xray', adding a direct path from 'tub' to 'dysp', and adding a direct path from 'bronc' to 'xray'. Each of these will be tested through targeted interventional experiments.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: tub \u2192 either (Reasoning: If 'tub' directly influences 'xray', then the indirect path through 'either' may be unnecessary. Removing this edge will test whether 'tub' has a direct effect on 'xray' or if the effect is entirely mediated through 'either'.)\n2. ADD: tub \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: Although 'tub' influences 'dysp' through 'either', it is possible that 'tub' has a direct effect on 'dysp'. Adding this edge will help determine if such a direct relationship exists.)\n3. ADD: bronc \u2192 xray (Reasoning: While 'bronc' influences 'dysp', we do not know if it has a direct effect on 'xray'. This edge could be added to test for a direct causal influence of 'bronc' on 'xray', independent of 'either'.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['asia', 'tub'], do(smoke) affects lung (avg_TVD=0.0038).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

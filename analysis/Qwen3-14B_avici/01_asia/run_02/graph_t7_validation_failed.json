The tentative notes highlight three key relationships: (1) tub \u2192 xray, (2) bronc \u2192 xray, and (3) asia \u2192 xray. These are all potential direct edges that may be indirectly mediated or non-existent. The current graph does not include these edges, so we must evaluate whether they should be added or if the existing structure is sufficient. To confirm, we design targeted interventional experiments for each candidate edge.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - asia \u2192 tub\n  - smoke \u2192 lung\n  - smoke \u2192 bronc\n  - tub \u2192 either\n  - lung \u2192 either\n  - either \u2192 xray\n  - either \u2192 dysp\n  - bronc \u2192 dysp\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: tub \u2192 xray (Reasoning: The current graph implies that tub influences xray only through the mediator 'either'. The tentative note suggests that the relationship between tub and xray is likely indirect and mediated by 'either', so there is no need for a direct edge.)\n2. DELETE: bronc \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Domain knowledge suggests a potential link between bronc and xray, but interventional evidence does not support it. Therefore, the direct edge bronc \u2192 xray is likely not present in the true causal graph.)\n3. DELETE: asia \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Similarly, domain knowledge suggests a potential link between asia and xray, but interventional evidence does not support it. Thus, the direct edge asia \u2192 xray is likely not present in the true causal graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['asia', 'tub'], do(smoke) affects lung (avg_TVD=0.0038).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

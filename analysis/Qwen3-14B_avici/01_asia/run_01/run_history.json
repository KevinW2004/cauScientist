However, based on the experimental intent and reasoning, the edge 'smoke \u2192 bronc' has been added in the current graph. This aligns with medical understanding that smoking is a known cause of bronchitis. Since this addition is supported by both domain knowledge and the intent to improve the model, it should be confirmed as a direct causal relationship.

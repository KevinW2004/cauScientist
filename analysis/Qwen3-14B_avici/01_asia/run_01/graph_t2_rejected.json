Smoking is a major risk factor for lung disease, including lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adding this edge would better reflect the causal mechanism in the asia domain and potentially improve the log-likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - either -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20496.964254270668\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

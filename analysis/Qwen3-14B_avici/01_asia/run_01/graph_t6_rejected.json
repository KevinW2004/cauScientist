However, based on the experimental intent and reasoning, the edge 'smoke \u2192 bronc' has been added in the current graph. This aligns with medical understanding that smoking is a known cause of bronchitis. Since this addition is supported by both domain knowledge and the intent to improve the model, it should be confirmed as a direct causal relationship. No further local amendments are necessary at this stage, as the graph appears to capture the key causal pathways related to tuberculosis diagnosis.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - smoke -> lung\n  - smoke -> bronc\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - either -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20100.311722043993\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -20113.4587, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'tub', 'xray')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -20947.6668, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'bronc', 'dysp')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

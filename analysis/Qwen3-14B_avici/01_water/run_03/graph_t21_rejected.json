This may be spurious, as the absence of an intermediate node could indicate that the effect is mediated through CBODN_12_15. Thus, the direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 may not be valid. To verify this, we should test whether intervening on CBODN_12_00 affects CBODN_12_30 while conditioning on CBODN_12_15. If the effect disappears, the direct edge is likely spurious and should be deleted. Additionally, we suspect that CBODN_12_15 may be influenced by CBODN_12_00 and possibly other variables like CBODD_12_00 or CNOD_12_00, which could be missing edges. Finally, we note that CNON_12_30 has an edge to CNON_12_15, which may be reversed, as time flows forward and CNON_12_15 is earlier than CNON_12_30. This reversal would better reflect temporal causality.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 may be spurious because it skips the intermediate time point CBODN_12_15. This suggests the effect could be mediated through the intermediate variable, making the direct edge unnecessary.)\n2. ADD: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15 (Reasoning: Given the time sequence and the absence of a direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_15, we suspect that CBODN_12_00 may influence CBODN_12_15, which in turn influences CBODN_12_30. Adding this edge would better reflect the temporal progression of the variable.)\n3. REVERSE: CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The current edge from CNON_12_30 to CNON_12_15 violates the forward-time assumption. Since CNON_12_15 occurs before CNON_12_30, the causal direction should be from CNON_12_15 to CNON_12_30, not the reverse.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CKNI_12_00 mean (p=0.2916).

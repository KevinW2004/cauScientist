This may be a spurious relationship if the true causal path is through CBODN_12_15. Therefore, the direct edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 should be investigated for deletion. Additionally, based on the temporal structure, we suspect that some variables at earlier time steps may influence variables at later time steps through intermediate variables. For example, CNON_12_00 might influence CNON_12_15, which in turn influences CNON_12_30 and CNON_12_45. Similarly, CKNN_12_00 might influence CKNN_12_15, which then influences CKNN_12_30 and CKNN_12_45. These relationships should be verified to ensure the graph is not missing any important intermediate variables or incorrectly assuming direct relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 may be spurious and could be mediated by the intermediate variable CBODN_12_15. Removing this edge would align with the assumption that changes at one time step propagate incrementally through subsequent time steps.)\n2. ADD: CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30 (Reasoning: If CNON_12_00 influences CNON_12_15, and CNON_12_15 in turn influences CNON_12_30, then the current graph may be missing the intermediate edge CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30, which would better represent the causal chain.)\n3. ADD: CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: Similar to the CNON variable, CKNN_12_00 influences CKNN_12_15, and it is plausible that CKNN_12_15 influences CKNN_12_30. Adding this edge would better reflect the temporal progression of the variable.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CKNI_12_00 mean (p=0.2916).

Each variable is connected in a chain from one time step to the next. However, the tentative note raises a concern about the edge 'CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30', which skips an intermediate time step (CBODN_12_15). This may indicate a spurious or indirect relationship. To improve the graph, we should consider removing this direct edge and instead rely on the intermediate step. Additionally, we suspect there may be direct causal relationships between variables at the same time step (e.g., C_NI_12_00 influencing CKNI_12_00 or CBODD_12_00) that are currently unmodeled. Lastly, the edge 'CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30' also skips a time step, similar to the CBODN case, and may be spurious.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 skips the intermediate time step (CBODN_12_15). This may imply that the relationship is not direct but mediated by the intermediate variable. Removing this edge would better reflect the temporal progression and avoid spurious inference.)\n2. ADD: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_00 (Reasoning: C_NI_12_00 and CKNI_12_00 are both nitrogen-related variables measured at the same time. It is plausible that C_NI_12_00 directly influences CKNI_12_00 through some chemical or biological process. Adding this edge would capture a potential contemporaneous causal relationship.)\n3. DELETE: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: Similar to the CBODN case, the direct edge from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30 skips an intermediate time point (CKNN_12_15). This may be a spurious relationship, and the true influence is likely mediated by the intermediate step.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CKNI_12_00 mean (p=0.2916).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

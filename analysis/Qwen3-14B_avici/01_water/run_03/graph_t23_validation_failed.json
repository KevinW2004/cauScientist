This suggests that the relationship may be mediated by the 15-minute time point, and the direct edge may be spurious. Therefore, the first candidate operation is to DELETE the direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30. To verify this, we can conduct an interventional experiment where we manipulate CBODN_12_00 and observe whether CBODN_12_30 changes directly, while conditioning on CBODN_12_15 to see if the intermediate variable explains the effect.\n\nNext, we notice that CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_15 is present in the graph, which suggests a reverse causal influence (future affecting past), which is not physically plausible in a water system. This edge should be REVERSED to CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30. To confirm this, we can perform an experiment where we manipulate CNON_12_15 and observe its effect on CNON_12_30, conditioning on any variables that might confound the relationship.\n\nFinally, we observe that CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 is present, but there is no edge from CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 or CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30. This suggests that CKNN_12_15 may be a missing mediator. Therefore, we suspect that CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 and CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 should be added. To test this, we can manipulate CKNN_12_00 and observe CKNN_12_15 and CKNN_12_30, while conditioning on other relevant variables.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 may be spurious due to the absence of an intermediate time step (CBODN_12_15), which is likely the true mediator in a water system. The presence of CBODN_12_15 in the dataset suggests that the effect of CBODN_12_00 on CBODN_12_30 is indirect.)\n2. REVERSE: CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30 (Reasoning: The current edge CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_15 implies a future event influencing a past event, which is not physically plausible in a water system. The correct direction should be from CNON_12_15 to CNON_12_30, reflecting the natural progression of time.)\n3. ADD: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: The direct edge from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30 is missing an intermediate step (CKNN_12_15), which may be the true causal mediator. Adding this edge would better represent the temporal progression of the variable.)\n4. ADD: CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: To complete the causal pathway from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30, we suspect that CKNN_12_15 acts as an intermediate variable. Adding this edge would better capture the sequential temporal relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CKNI_12_00 mean (p=0.2916).

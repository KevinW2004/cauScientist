This supports the deletion of this edge. Since this operation was previously attempted and failed due to invalid operations, it is critical to ensure we are only modifying edges that are currently present in the graph. The current graph does not include this edge, so it cannot be deleted. Therefore, we focus on the edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30, which may be spurious due to the absence of an intermediate step (CBODN_12_15). However, previous attempts to delete this edge also failed due to it not being in the valid operations. This suggests that the edge is not present in the graph, and thus, we cannot delete it.

However, the tentative note indicates that the edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 may be spurious, as it skips the intermediate time step (12:15). This suggests that the influence from 12:00 to 12:30 may not be direct but rather mediated by the 12:15 value. To improve the graph, we should investigate this edge and possibly delete it. Additionally, we should verify whether the intermediate time step (CBODN_12_15) has a direct influence on CBODN_12_30, which would support a more accurate causal structure. Lastly, we should check for potential feedback or reverse causation between variables that may not be captured by the current unidirectional time-based edges.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 may be spurious as it skips the intermediate time step CBODN_12_15. If the influence is indirect, this edge should be removed to reflect a more accurate causal structure.)\n2. ADD: CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: If the influence from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 is indirect, it is likely mediated by CBODN_12_15. Adding this direct edge would better represent the temporal progression and potential causal influence.)\n3.

Reversing this edge allows us to test for potential feedback mechanisms.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_30 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CKNI_12_00 mean (p=0.2916).

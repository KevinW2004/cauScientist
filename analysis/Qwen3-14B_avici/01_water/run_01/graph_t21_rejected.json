This suggests that the observed relationship might be due to a confounding variable or indirect influence rather than a direct causal link. To verify this, we should test whether manipulating C_NI_12_00 has a direct effect on CBODD_12_00, while controlling for other variables that may mediate or confound this relationship. Additionally, based on the temporal structure of the variables (e.g., C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45), it is likely that some variables are influenced by earlier time points in a way not fully captured. For example, CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_15 might be better modeled as a direct influence from CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15. Finally, it is possible that CBODD_12_00 influences CKNN_12_15, which is not currently represented in the graph, and this may be an important missing causal pathway.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 (Reasoning: The direct edge C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 is flagged as potentially spurious. This could be due to a confounder or indirect pathway. Removing this edge will help test whether the relationship is direct or spurious.)\n2. DELETE: CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_15 (Reasoning: CKNN_12_15 may be a downstream effect of CKNN_12_00, which could influence CBODD_12_15 directly. Removing the edge CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_15 will help determine if the relationship is direct or mediated.)\n3. ADD: CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: There may be a causal influence from CBODD_12_00 to CKNN_12_15 that is not currently represented.

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

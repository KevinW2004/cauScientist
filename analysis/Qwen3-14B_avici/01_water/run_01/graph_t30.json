This suggests that there is a direct or indirect causal influence from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_15.

This suggests the need to investigate whether this relationship is direct or if it is mediated by other variables. Additionally, the graph lacks explicit relationships between variables across different time points (e.g., C_NI_12_00 to C_NI_12_15, etc.) that are already present. However, the current structure appears to represent temporal dependencies, which may be over-simplified. A more robust model may require adding or reversing edges to reflect indirect influences or feedback loops. The following candidate operations are proposed based on this reasoning.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 (Reasoning: This edge is flagged as potentially spurious. If the effect of C_NI_12_00 on CBODD_12_00 is not directly observable after intervening, it may be mediated by other variables, and thus the edge should be deleted.)\n2. ADD: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 (Reasoning: CKNN_12_00 is already influencing CBODD_12_15 through the current graph. It is plausible that CKNN_12_00 also directly influences CBODD_12_00, which could be a missing link in the current model.)\n3. REVERSE: CBODD_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_00 (Reasoning: It is possible that the observed relationship is reversed; that is, CBODD_12_00 might influence C_NI_12_00 rather than the other way around. This could be the case if CBODD_12_00 reflects a downstream effect of C_NI_12_00, but the measurement or model assumes the reverse.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CNON_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CBODD_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CNOD_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_45 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(CKNN_12_15) affects CKNN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

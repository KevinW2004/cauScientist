This suggests that the observed relationship might not be direct, but rather mediated by other variables or due to confounding. Additionally, the graph lacks explicit connections between variables that share similar suffixes (e.g., CKNN, CKND, CNOD, CBODN, CNON) across time points, which may suggest interdependencies that are not yet modeled. Finally, the temporal structure of the graph appears to be based on a strict 15-minute interval progression, but there is no explicit feedback or cyclic structure, which is expected in a DAG. Therefore, three candidate operations are proposed: (1) deleting the C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 edge, (2) adding a potential edge from CKNN_12_00 to CBODD_12_00, and (3) adding a potential edge from CNON_12_00 to CBODD_12_00. These are based on domain knowledge of water chemistry and the need to ensure the graph reflects direct causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the edge from C_NI_12_00 to CBODD_12_00 may be spurious. This could be due to a confounding variable or a mediating effect not yet modeled. Removing this edge would allow us to test whether the relationship is direct or indirect.)\n2. ADD: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 (Reasoning: CKNN (likely related to nitrate or nitrogen) and CBODD (likely related to biochemical oxygen demand) are both water quality parameters. Domain knowledge suggests that nitrogen compounds can influence oxygen demand in water, so a direct causal influence from CKNN_12_00 to CBODD_12_00 is plausible.)\n3. ADD: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_00 (Reasoning: CNON (likely related to nitrate or nitrogen) and CBODD are both water quality parameters. Similar to CKNN, CNON may directly influence CBODD through chemical processes in water, making a direct causal relationship plausible.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CNON_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CBODD_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CNOD_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_45 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(CKNN_12_15) affects CKNN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

This implies that the direct edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 may not exist and should be deleted. Additionally, based on the structure of the graph, there may be missing direct relationships between variables at the same time point (e.g., C_NI_12_00 and CKNI_12_00). Also, the current graph lacks direct edges between variables like CKND_12_00 and CKND_12_15, which could represent immediate temporal dependencies. These three candidate changes\u2014deleting the CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 edge, adding CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15, and adding C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_00\u2014are proposed for refinement.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 may be indirect, mediated by CBODN_12_15. If this is the case, the direct edge is unnecessary and should be removed.)\n2. ADD: CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15 (Reasoning: The current graph lacks a direct edge from CKND_12_00 to CKND_12_15, which may represent a direct temporal influence. Adding this edge could better capture immediate causal dynamics.)\n3. ADD: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_00 (Reasoning: There is no direct edge from C_NI_12_00 to CKNI_12_00 in the current graph. Given that these variables are measured at the same time and likely represent related water quality parameters, a direct causal influence may exist.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CNON_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CBODD_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CNOD_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_45 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment C_NI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_00: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(CKNN_12_15) affects CKNN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

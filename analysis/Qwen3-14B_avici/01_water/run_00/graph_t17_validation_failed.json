The tentative notes highlight two key areas for refinement: (1) the potential spurious edge from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15, and (2) the potential reverse influence between CNON_12_15 and CNOD_12_15. Additionally, there is a missing direct relationship between CNON_12_00 and CNOD_12_15 that may be mediated through CNON_12_15. These three candidates are prioritized for refinement to ensure the graph reflects accurate causal dependencies.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CNOD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The edge CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 may be spurious. If CNON_12_15 is influenced by CNOD_12_15, then the direct influence of CNON_12_00 on CNON_12_15 may be mediated or nonexistent.)\n2. REVERSE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The current edge CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 may be incorrectly directed. A reverse edge could reflect a feedback or reverse causal influence, which needs to be confirmed.)\n3. ADD: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 (Reasoning: There may be a direct causal influence from CNON_12_00 to CNOD_12_15 that is currently unaccounted for, possibly through a time-lagged mechanism or a direct chemical transformation.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(CNOD_12_00) affects CNOD_12_15 mean (p=0.0000).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

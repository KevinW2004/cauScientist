However, two specific relationships in the tentative notes warrant further investigation. First, the edge CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 may be spurious, and we suspect CNOD_12_15 might act as a mediator. Second, the edge CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 could be reversed or have a more complex causal relationship than currently modeled. We also propose adding a potential feedback loop between CNOD and CNON variables, as these appear to be interrelated in water quality dynamics (e.g., nitrogen and oxygen levels may influence each other). These three operations (DELETE, REVERSE, ADD) are prioritized for verification.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CNOD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The edge CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 may be spurious. If CNOD_12_15 acts as a mediator, then the direct influence from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15 may not exist once CNOD is accounted for.)\n2. REVERSE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The current edge CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 assumes that CNON influences CNOD. However, water chemistry often involves bidirectional relationships, and it is possible that CNOD influences CNON instead.)\n3. ADD: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: There may be a direct feedback mechanism between CNOD and CNON. For example, changes in dissolved oxygen (CNOD) could influence nitrogen compounds (CNON) through biological or chemical processes, and this relationship may not be fully captured in the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(CNOD_12_00) affects CNOD_12_15 mean (p=0.0000).

The existing edges primarily reflect temporal dependencies, where variables at an earlier time point influence those at a later time point. However, there is an unresolved uncertainty regarding the edge 'CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00', which was previously attempted for deletion but failed due to constraints. This suggests that the relationship may be important, but its direction or existence is unclear. Additionally, we should evaluate whether any other potential causal relationships exist that are not currently represented in the graph, particularly among variables that are conceptually related in the water domain (e.g., nitrogen and oxygen dynamics, biochemical oxygen demand). Based on this, we propose three candidate operations: (1) DELETE the uncertain edge 'CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00', (2) ADD a direct edge from 'CNON_12_00' to 'CNOD_12_00', and (3) ADD a direct edge from 'CKND_12_00' to 'CBODN_12_00'. These operations are motivated by the need to refine the graph to better reflect known water chemistry relationships and to resolve ambiguous or unverified edges.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: The edge 'CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00' was previously attempted for deletion but failed due to constraints, indicating uncertainty about its validity. This relationship may not be direct, and removing it would simplify the graph and align it more closely with domain knowledge if the influence is indirect or spurious.)\n2. ADD: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_00 (Reasoning: Nitrogen compounds (e.g., CNON) can influence the oxidation of nitrogen (CNOD) in water, especially in the presence of oxygen. Adding this edge would reflect a potential direct causal relationship between these two variables.)\n3. ADD: CKND_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: CKND (likely a form of potassium or another cation) may influence biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) by altering the chemical environment in which organic matter decomposes. Adding this edge would allow the model to capture potential chemical interactions between cations and BOD.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CNON_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CBODN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

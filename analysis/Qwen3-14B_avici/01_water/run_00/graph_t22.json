However, the tentative notes suggest that some relationships may be spurious or indirect. For example, the absence of a direct effect from C_NI_12_00 to CKNI_12_00 under intervention implies that the existing graph may not capture all indirect or feedback relationships. Additionally, the lack of a direct effect from CNON_12_00 to CBODN_12_00 suggests that other variables may mediate this relationship. To refine the graph, I propose three candidate operations: adding a direct edge between CNON_12_00 and CBODN_12_00, reversing the direction of the edge from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30, and adding an edge from CNON_12_15 to CKNN_12_15, based on potential feedback or mediation patterns in water quality dynamics.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the absence of a direct effect from CNON_12_00 to CBODN_12_00 may indicate a spurious or indirect relationship. However, based on water chemistry, nitrogen compounds (CNON) can influence biochemical oxygen demand (CBODN), suggesting a direct causal link that may be masked or unmodeled in the current graph.)\n2. REVERSE: CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 (Reasoning: The current graph has a direct edge from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30, implying that earlier values influence later ones. However, in water systems, feedback loops or delayed effects may suggest that later measurements can influence earlier ones (e.g., via sensor recalibration or data correction). Reversing this edge would test for such feedback.)\n3. ADD: CNON_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: In water quality monitoring, nitrogen compounds (CNON) can influence potassium-related measurements (CKNN) through chemical interactions or sensor interference. Adding a direct edge from CNON_12_15 to CKNN_12_15 would test for a potential direct causal influence.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CNON_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CBODN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

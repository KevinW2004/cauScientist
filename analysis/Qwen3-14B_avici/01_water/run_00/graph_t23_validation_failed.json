Each variable at time t is connected to the same variable at time t+15, indicating a default assumption of direct temporal causality. However, the tentative note indicates that the relationship 'CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_00' is likely indirect or spurious, and no significant effect was observed in interventional experiments. This suggests that the current graph may include unnecessary or incorrect edges. Based on this, I propose three candidate operations: (1) DELETE the edge CNON_12_00 -> CBODN_12_00, (2) ADD a potential reverse edge CBODN_12_00 -> CNON_12_00, and (3) DELETE the edge CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_30, as it appears to bypass the intermediate time point (CKNN_12_15), which may indicate a missing or incorrect temporal connection.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that this relationship is likely indirect or spurious. An interventional experiment showed no significant effect, suggesting that the edge should be removed to improve the accuracy of the causal graph.)\n2. ADD: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_00 (Reasoning: If the original edge was spurious, it is possible that the true causal direction is reversed. This reversal could better represent the actual dynamics of the water system, particularly if CBODN (Chemical Oxygen Demand) influences CNON (Nitrate or Nitrite).)\n3. DELETE: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: The current graph skips the intermediate time point (CKNN_12_15) in this edge. This may suggest an incorrect or direct connection that bypasses the natural temporal progression. A more accurate graph would include the intermediate time point as an intermediary node.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CNON_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CBODN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

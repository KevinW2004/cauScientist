Therefore, we propose to DELETE this edge. Additionally, we observe that several variables at the 12:00 time point influence later time points (e.g., 12:15, 12:30, 12:45), which suggests that there might be additional temporal or causal dependencies that are not currently modeled. For example, it is possible that CKND_12_00 influences CNON_12_15 or CNOD_12_15 through some intermediate process. Lastly, we note that the current graph does not include any explicit connections between variables across different time points beyond the direct sequential links (e.g., 12:00 \u2192 12:15, 12:15 \u2192 12:30, etc.), so we suspect there may be cross-timepoint relationships that are currently unmodeled.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that this relationship is likely indirect or spurious. Removing it will help refine the graph to reflect only direct causal influences.)\n2. ADD: CKND_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: There is a plausible causal mechanism where CKND (likely a chemical or nutrient) at 12:00 could influence CNON (possibly a nitrogen compound) at 12:15 through biogeochemical processes. This relationship is not currently represented in the graph.)\n3. ADD: CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15 (Reasoning: CNOD (likely a dissolved oxygen or organic matter) at 12:00 may influence CBODN (biochemical oxygen demand nitrogen) at 12:15. This could reflect a temporal relationship in water quality dynamics that is currently unmodeled.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CNON_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CBODN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

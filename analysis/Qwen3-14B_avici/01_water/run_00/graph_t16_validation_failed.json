However, based on the tentative notes, certain direct links (e.g., C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_00 and CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00) are not supported by the data, suggesting they may be spurious or indirect. This implies that the graph may be overfitting or including unnecessary direct links. To refine the graph, I propose three candidate operations: deleting unsupported direct links, adding plausible indirect links, and reversing potential reverse causality. Each proposed operation is supported by domain knowledge and the tentative notes, and each is accompanied by a targeted experiment to validate its presence or absence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates no significant effect of C_NI_12_00 on CKNI_12_00 under intervention, suggesting this direct link is not causal and may be spurious or indirect.)\n2. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates no significant effect of CNON_12_00 on CBODN_12_00 under intervention, suggesting this direct link is not causal and may be spurious or indirect.)\n3. ADD: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: In the water domain, chemical oxygen demand (CBODN) can be influenced by nitrogen compounds such as CKNN (likely a form of potassium nitrate or similar). This indirect relationship may explain the observed temporal correlation between CKNN and CBODN, which is not yet captured in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CNON_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CBODN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

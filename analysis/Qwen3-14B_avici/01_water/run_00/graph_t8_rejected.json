The tentative notes specifically highlight two relationships that were not supported by interventional data: (1) C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_00 and (2) CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00. These suggest that these direct links may be spurious or indirect and should be deleted. Additionally, the current graph lacks explicit connections between variables at the same timepoint, which may be important for modeling concurrent effects. For example, C_NI_12_00 and CKNI_12_00 could be related through some unobserved mechanism, warranting an exploratory addition of a bidirectional edge or a latent confounder. However, since we are limited to three operations, we focus on the deletions and one potential addition based on domain knowledge.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that no significant effect was observed under intervention for this direct link, suggesting it may be spurious or indirect. Removing this edge aligns with the observed data and improves the graph's accuracy.)\n2. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates no significant effect was observed under intervention for this direct link. Removing this edge aligns with the observed data and improves the graph's accuracy.)\n3. ADD: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_00 (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, CKNN (Chemical Oxygen Demand - Nitrogen) may influence CNON (Nitrogen Oxide) through chemical processes. Adding this edge provides a plausible direct causal relationship that may be missing from the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CNON_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CBODN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: C_NI_12_00\u2192CKNI_12_00, C_NI_12_00\u2192CKNI_12_00, C_NI_12_00\u2192CKNI_12_00, CNON_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_00\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

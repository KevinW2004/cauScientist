The edge 'CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15' may be spurious. This is suggested by the note that CNOD_12_15 could act as a mediator. If CNOD_12_15 is influenced by CNON_12_00, then the direct link from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15 may be indirect or spurious. An experiment would help confirm whether this link is direct or mediated.\n\n2. The edge 'CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15' may have reverse influence. The note suggests the need to test for reverse causality. If the influence is actually from CNOD_12_15 to CNON_12_15, reversing the edge would improve the graph.\n\n3. There is a potential missing relationship between CNON_12_00 and CNOD_12_15, which could act as a mediator. If CNON_12_00 influences CNOD_12_15 directly, this would explain the spurious edge 'CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15' and provide a more accurate causal pathway. Adding this edge would improve the graph\u2019s accuracy.\n\nFor each of these candidates, targeted experiments are designed to test the causal direction and presence of the relationship.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CNOD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The edge may be spurious, and CNOD_12_15 could act as a mediator. If CNOD_12_15 is influenced by CNON_12_00, then the direct link from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15 may not be direct.)\n2. REVERSE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The note suggests that the direction of the edge 'CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15' may be reversed. Testing for reverse influence is necessary to confirm the true causal direction.)\n3. ADD: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 (Reasoning: If CNON_12_00 influences CNOD_12_15 directly, this would provide a more accurate causal pathway and explain the potential spurious edge from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKND_12_00 -> CKND_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(CNOD_12_00) affects CNOD_12_15 mean (p=0.0000).

However, the presence of some indirect or potentially spurious relationships needs to be re-evaluated. Specifically, the tentative note highlights uncertainty about the relationship CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00, which was previously attempted for deletion but failed due to constraints. This suggests that the relationship may be indirect or non-causal. Additionally, based on domain knowledge, we suspect that CBODN_12_00 may be influenced by other variables such as CNON_12_00 or CKND_12_00, and that there may be missing direct causal links between variables at the same time point. We propose three candidate operations: 1) deleting the uncertain CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 edge, 2) adding a direct edge from CKND_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00, and 3) adding a direct edge from CNON_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_00, based on plausible water chemistry interactions.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: This edge was previously attempted for deletion but failed due to constraints. Re-evaluation is necessary to determine if it is a spurious or indirect relationship. If the deletion is valid, it would simplify the graph and remove unnecessary complexity.)\n2. ADD: CKND_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, CKND (likely chemical oxygen demand or a related parameter) may directly influence CBODN (a nitrogen-related parameter) at the same time point. Adding this edge could better capture the causal dynamics in water chemistry.)\n3. ADD: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 (Reasoning: CNON (likely nitrate or another nitrogen oxide) may directly influence CKNN (possibly a potassium or another nutrient-related parameter). Adding this edge would reflect a direct chemical interaction between these two variables.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_15 -> CNON_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(C_NI_12_00) affects CBODN_12_00 mean (p=nan).

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Based on the tentative notes, three specific relationships are under scrutiny for being indirect or spurious. These include CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15, CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30, and CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45. These are suspected to be indirect or non-causal based on domain knowledge, and interventional experiments are required to verify their validity. The proposed candidate operations aim to refine the graph by removing or modifying these potentially spurious edges. Experiments will involve direct interventions and conditional observations to assess whether these relationships are causal.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: This edge is suspected to be indirect or spurious based on domain knowledge. There is no direct causal mechanism known between CBODN (Chemical Oxygen Demand, Nitrogen) at time 00 and CKNN (possibly a form of nitrogen compound) at time 15. This relationship may be mediated by other unobserved variables or could be a statistical artifact.)\n2. DELETE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: This edge is suspected to be indirect based on domain knowledge. CNOD (Nitrogen Oxide) at 15 minutes influencing CBODN (Chemical Oxygen Demand, Nitrogen) at 30 minutes may not represent a direct causal effect. It is more likely that this relationship is mediated through other variables such as flow rate or temperature, which are not explicitly modeled.)\n3. DELETE: CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45 (Reasoning: This edge is suspected to be indirect based on domain knowledge. CKNN (a nitrogen compound) at 30 minutes influencing CNON (another nitrogen compound) at 45 minutes is not directly supported by known biochemical or hydrological pathways. This may be a result of a confounding variable or a statistical correlation rather than a direct causal effect.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CBODN_12_15\u2192CKNN_12_30; DELETE: CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_15\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

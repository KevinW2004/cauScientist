The tentative note highlights that the edge CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 is suspected to be indirect and has previously failed deletion attempts. This suggests that there may be an unobserved intermediate variable or that the relationship is not direct. To improve the graph, we need to investigate this edge further. Additionally, we can consider adding or reversing other edges based on domain knowledge and logical flow. For instance, the CNOD (Nitrate) variable could influence CBODN (Chemical Oxygen Demand in Nitrate) directly, and the current graph may not fully capture this. Furthermore, the CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 edge might be better represented as a direct influence through CNOD_12_15, which could be tested. Lastly, the CKND (Chemical Kinetic Nitrate) variable may have a direct influence on CNON (Chemical Oxygen Demand in Nitrate Oxide), which could be tested.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The edge CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 is suspected to be indirect based on previous failed deletion attempts. This suggests the relationship may be mediated by other variables, and removing it could improve the graph's accuracy.)\n2. ADD: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_15 (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, nitrate (CNOD) is likely to directly influence the chemical oxygen demand in nitrate (CBODN) at the same time point. Adding this direct edge may better represent the causal flow.)\n3. REVERSE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The current graph assumes that CBODN_12_00 directly influences CBODN_12_30. However, this could be a reverse relationship where the later measurement influences the earlier one due to feedback or measurement error. Reversing this edge could help capture the correct temporal dynamics.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

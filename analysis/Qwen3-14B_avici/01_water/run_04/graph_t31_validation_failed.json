This suggests that the influence may be mediated by one or more intermediate variables. To improve the graph, we need to investigate whether this edge is truly indirect by identifying and testing potential intermediate variables. Additionally, we should check for missing direct relationships and possible reversed edges that may better represent the causal flow. Based on the structure of the variables (which are all measured at different time points, likely from a water quality monitoring system), we suspect that some variables may influence others across time steps in a more direct manner, especially if they are chemically or biologically related (e.g., nitrogen and oxygen species).\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: This edge is suspected to be indirect, and previous deletion attempts have failed. This suggests the presence of an unaccounted intermediate variable. A direct edge may not be appropriate without further validation.)\n2. ADD: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_15 (Reasoning: Given the time proximity between 12:15 and 12:30, and the suspected indirect influence from CNOD_12_15 to CBODN_12_30, it is plausible that CNOD_12_15 directly affects CBODN_12_15, which in turn affects CBODN_12_30.)\n3. REVERSE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 (Reasoning: The current graph has CBODN_12_00 as a parent of CBODN_12_15 and CBODN_12_30, but CNOD_12_15 is a parent of CBODN_12_30. It is possible that CBODN_12_00 is influenced by CNOD_12_15 rather than the other way around, especially if there is a feedback loop or delayed response in the system.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error -

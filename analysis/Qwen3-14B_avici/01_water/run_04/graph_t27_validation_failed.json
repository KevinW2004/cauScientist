This implies that there may be an intermediate variable or a chain of variables that connects CNOD_12_15 to CBODN_12_30. To verify whether this relationship is direct or indirect, we should investigate potential intermediate variables such as CNOD_12_30 or CBODN_12_15. Additionally, there may be missing direct relationships between variables that are temporally adjacent but not currently connected in the graph. For example, CBODN_12_15 might influence CBODN_12_30 directly, but this is not explicitly stated in the current graph. Similarly, CNON_12_15 might influence CNON_12_30 directly, and this could be an overlooked direct relationship. We propose three candidate operations: deleting the indirect edge CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30, adding a direct edge from CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30, and adding a direct edge from CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: This edge is suspected to be indirect based on previous failed deletion attempts and the tentative note. If there is an intermediate variable (e.g., CNOD_12_30 or CBODN_12_15), the direct influence may not exist.)\n2. ADD: CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: Although CBODN_12_00 and CBODN_12_15 influence CBODN_12_30, there is no direct edge from CBODN_12_15 to CBODN_12_30 in the current graph. This direct influence is plausible and could improve the graph's accuracy.)\n3. ADD: CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30 (Reasoning: CNON_12_15 influences CNON_12_30 indirectly through CNON_12_45, but there is no direct edge from CNON_12_15 to CNON_12_30. Adding this edge would better reflect the temporal progression and direct influence of the variable.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

The notes suggest potential indirect or spurious relationships that may not be directly causal. To verify these, targeted interventional experiments are designed to test for direct causal influence.\n\n1. The tentative note suggests that the relationship CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 may be indirect or spurious. This implies that the current edge may not represent a direct causal influence and could be removed or replaced with a more plausible path.\n\n2. The relationship CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 is also suspected to be indirect. This suggests that the direct influence might be masked by other intermediaries, and a direct causal link may not exist.\n\n3. The tentative note suggests that CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45 may be indirect. This implies that the current edge may not represent a direct causal relationship and should be further tested.\n\nFor each of these, we propose interventional experiments that manipulate the parent variable and observe the effect on the child, while conditioning on relevant variables to control for confounding.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from CBODN_12_00 to CKNN_12_15 may be indirect or spurious. This implies that the direct influence may not exist, and the edge should be tested for removal.)\n2. DELETE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the relationship from CNOD_12_15 to CBODN_12_30 may be indirect. This suggests that the direct influence may be masked, and the edge should be tested for deletion.)\n3. DELETE: CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from CKNN_12_30 to CNON_12_45 may be indirect. This implies that the direct influence may not exist, and the edge should be tested for removal.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_30 -> CNON_12_45: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_30 -> CNON_12_45: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNON_12_45 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_30 -> CNOD_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_30 -> CNON_12_45: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_30 -> CNON_12_45: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CNOD_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CKNN_12_30 -> CNON_12_45: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -282383.8229137782\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

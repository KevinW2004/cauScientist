The tentative note highlights a potential indirect relationship between CNOD_12_15 and CBODN_12_30, suggesting the need to explore intermediate variables. Based on domain knowledge in water quality, chemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrogen-related variables (like CNOD and CBODN) are often interrelated through biological and chemical processes. Thus, we suspect there may be a direct or indirect causal pathway between these variables. We propose three candidate operations: (1) DELETE the indirect edge CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30, (2) ADD a direct edge from CNOD_12_15 to CBODN_12_15, and (3) ADD an edge from CKND_12_15 to CBODN_12_30, as CKND (chemical nitrogen demand) may influence BODN (biological oxygen demand nitrogen) over time. Experiments will be designed to test these hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: The current edge CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 is suspected to be indirect. If there is no direct effect of CNOD_12_15 on CBODN_12_30, this edge should be removed to reflect the true causal structure.)\n2. ADD: CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_15 (Reasoning: Based on water quality dynamics, nitrogenous compounds (like CNOD) can directly influence BODN at the same time point through chemical or biological interactions. Adding this edge would better reflect the direct relationship.)\n3. ADD: CKND_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 (Reasoning: Chemical nitrogen demand (CKND) may influence biological oxygen demand nitrogen (CBODN) over time through chemical reactions or microbial activity. Adding this edge would capture a potential direct influence of CKND on CBODN after a time delay.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15: Error -

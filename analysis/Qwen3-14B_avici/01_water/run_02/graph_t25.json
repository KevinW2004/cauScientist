However, some edges may be spurious or missing. Based on the tentative note, the edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 is flagged for further testing. This suggests that the influence might be indirect, possibly mediated through CKNN_12_15. Additionally, there may be missing direct relationships between variables at the same time point, such as between CKNN and other variables like CNON or CBODN. Lastly, the current graph lacks explicit feedback loops or cross-variable influences that may exist in water quality dynamics.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: The current graph suggests a direct influence from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30, but the tentative note indicates this may be spurious or indirect. This edge could be removed if evidence shows CKNN_12_15 is the true mediator.)\n2. ADD: CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: In water quality systems, chemical species such as CKNN (likely a potassium-related compound) can influence nitrogen species like CNON. A direct relationship between CKNN_12_15 and CNON_12_15 may be missing in the current graph.)\n3. ADD: CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: Chemical oxygen demand (CBODD) can influence the availability or transformation of potassium-related compounds (CKNN) in water.

Based on this, we propose to investigate this edge first. Additionally, we observe that CNON_12_15 influences CNON_12_30, but there is no clear path from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_30, suggesting a potential missing edge from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15. Lastly, CKND_12_15 influences multiple downstream variables (CBODD_12_15, CNOD_12_15, CNON_12_15), but there is no direct link from CKND_12_00 to CKND_12_15, which may be a missing edge.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the link from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30 may be spurious. This edge could be a result of confounding or indirect influences rather than a direct causal relationship.)\n2. ADD: CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: There is a direct influence from CNON_12_15 to CNON_12_30, but no direct link from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15. This suggests a possible missing direct causal pathway from CNON_12_00 to CNON_12_15.)\n3. ADD: CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15 (Reasoning: CKND_12_15 influences multiple downstream variables, but there is no direct link from CKND_12_00 to CKND_12_15. This suggests a missing direct causal link that could explain the influence of CKND_12_00 on the system.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

This is suspicious because it implies that CKNN_12_15 is not a necessary intermediate step in the causal chain, which may not align with the natural temporal progression of water quality variables. To validate this, we should test whether CKNN_12_15 is indeed a mediator or if the direct link from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30 is spurious. Additionally, we suspect that CKND_12_15 may be a parent to multiple downstream variables, and we should test whether it is a direct cause of CBODD_12_15, CNOD_12_15, and CNON_12_15. Lastly, we need to verify whether C_NI_12_00 directly influences CKND_12_15, as this could be an indirect effect through another unmodeled variable.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: The current graph has a direct edge from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30 that bypasses CKNN_12_15, which is an intermediate time point. This may not reflect the true causal process, which likely involves CKNN_12_15 as a mediator. We should test if the direct link is spurious.)\n2. ADD: CKND_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: CKND_12_15 is already a parent of CBODD_12_15, CNOD_12_15, and CBODN_12_15. It is plausible that CKND_12_15 also directly influences CNON_12_15, which is a nitrogen-related variable, potentially through a shared chemical or biological process.)\n3. REVERSE: CKND_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_00 (Reasoning: The current graph has an edge from C_NI_12_00 to CKND_12_15, suggesting that C_NI_12_00 is a cause of CKND_12_15. However, this may be reversed if CKND_12_15 is an upstream indicator or measurement that influences the nitrogen content later in the process.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error -

Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, some relationships may be spurious or lack direct causal evidence. Based on the tentative note, the link CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 is flagged for further testing. This link may be indirect or spurious, as it skips over CKNN_12_15, which is also connected to CKNN_12_30. To confirm the directness of this relationship, we need to test if CKNN_12_00 has a direct influence on CKNN_12_30, independent of CKNN_12_15. Additionally, we suspect that CKND_12_15 may directly influence CBODD_12_15, which is already present in the graph, but we want to ensure there are no missing edges. Lastly, we suspect that CNON_12_15 might influence C_NI_12_30, which is not currently represented in the graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 (Reasoning: The direct link from CKNN_12_00 to CKNN_12_30 may be spurious, as CKNN_12_15 is already an intermediate node in the chain. If this relationship is not direct, removing it would improve the graph's accuracy.)\n2. ADD: CKND_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_15 (Reasoning: This relationship is already present in the graph, but we want to confirm that it is direct and not mediated by other unobserved variables. Adding it explicitly ensures that we are testing its direct influence.)\n3. ADD: CNON_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30 (Reasoning: There is no explicit link between CNON_12_15 and C_NI_12_30 in the current graph. Based on the temporal progression and the presence of other influencing variables, we suspect a direct causal influence may exist and warrant further investigation.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

The tentative note highlights that the edge CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 is based on domain knowledge and requires experimental validation. Additionally, there are several indirect relationships and potential confounding factors that may be unaccounted for. For example, CKND_12_15 influences multiple downstream variables (CBODD_12_15, CNOD_12_15, CNON_12_15), which may suggest a more centralized role for CKND. Similarly, C_NI_12_15 influences CNON_12_30 directly, which could be a confounding pathway that needs clarification. Finally, the direct influence of CKNN_12_00 on CKNN_12_30 may be better explained by intermediate steps, and an additional edge may be missing.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: This edge is marked as tentative in the notes and may be spurious. It is based on domain knowledge but lacks direct experimental validation. If CKNN_12_15 does not directly influence CNON_12_15, removing this edge would simplify the graph and improve its accuracy.)\n2. ADD: CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: CKND_12_15 appears to influence multiple downstream variables, including CNON_12_15. Given the structure, it is plausible that CKND_12_15 also influences CKNN_12_15, possibly through shared nitrogen pathways. Adding this edge would better capture the causal flow.)\n3. REVERSE: CNON_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30 (Reasoning: The current graph has a direct edge from C_NI_12_15 to CNON_12_30. However, it's unclear whether this is a direct effect or if CNON_12_15 could be influencing C_NI_12_30 through feedback loops or delayed effects. Reversing this edge would allow testing for reverse causation.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

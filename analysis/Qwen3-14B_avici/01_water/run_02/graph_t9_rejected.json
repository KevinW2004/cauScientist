However, the tentative notes highlight two uncertain edges: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15 and C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15. These edges lack interventional support, and their presence may be spurious or indirect. To improve the graph, we should test whether these relationships are direct or should be removed. Additionally, we suspect that CKND_12_15 might have a direct influence on CNON_12_15, which is already in the graph, but we should test for potential direct influences between other variables that might be missing, such as C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_00, which could represent a direct initial influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15 (Reasoning: This edge lacks interventional support and may be an indirect or spurious relationship. Removing it could improve the graph\u2019s accuracy if no direct causal influence is confirmed.)\n2. DELETE: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: This edge lacks interventional support and may be an indirect or spurious relationship. It should be tested for direct causality before being retained in the graph.)\n3. ADD: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_00 (Reasoning: A direct influence of C_NI_12_00 on CNON_12_00 might be missing, which could explain some of the later observed relationships. Adding this edge could improve the model\u2019s explanatory power.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

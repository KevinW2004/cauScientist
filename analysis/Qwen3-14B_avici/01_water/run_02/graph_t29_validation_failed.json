The tentative note highlights the edge CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 as a candidate for verification. This edge is based on domain knowledge suggesting that CKNN (likely a measure of potassium or another cation) may influence nitrogen dynamics (CNON). However, this relationship is not yet confirmed. Additionally, there are several other relationships in the graph that may be questionable or missing based on domain knowledge and logical consistency. For example, CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30 and CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45 may be influenced by other variables not currently in the graph, such as flow rate or temperature. Also, there are no direct edges from C_NI to CNON, which may be an important relationship in nitrogen transformation processes. Based on this, I propose the following three candidate operations for refinement.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The edge CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 is tentative and based on domain knowledge, but it lacks direct experimental confirmation. If this relationship is not supported by interventional data, it should be removed to avoid overfitting the graph.)\n2. ADD: C_NI_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: C_NI (likely a measure of nitrate or another nitrogen species) is a key driver of nitrogen dynamics. It is plausible that C_NI_12_15 directly influences CNON_12_15 through chemical or biological processes. This edge is missing in the current graph and should be tested.)\n3. ADD: CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: Chemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrogen dynamics are closely related in water systems. It is reasonable to hypothesize that CBODN_12_15 may influence CNON_12_15 through microbial activity or nutrient cycling. This relationship is not currently represented in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30: Error -

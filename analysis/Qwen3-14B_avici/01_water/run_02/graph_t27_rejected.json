The relationships are mostly straightforward, with variables at time t influencing those at time t+15. However, certain edges are tentative, such as CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15, and may not be fully supported by the data or domain knowledge. Additionally, the graph may be missing some direct causal relationships that could be inferred from water chemistry principles. Based on the tentative note, I propose to examine the CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 edge more closely, as well as consider potential additions or reversals that align with known chemical processes in water systems.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 (Reasoning: The edge CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_15 is marked as tentative in the notes. While it may be plausible that CKNN (likely a potassium-nitrogen compound) influences nitrogen dynamics, this relationship is not strongly supported by direct evidence in the graph. An interventional experiment is needed to confirm its validity.)\n2. ADD: C_NI_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, total nitrogen (C_NI) can influence the formation of potassium-nitrogen compounds (CKNN) over time. Since CKNN_12_15 is influenced by other variables, adding a direct link from C_NI_12_00 to CKNN_12_15 could better represent the underlying chemical processes.)\n3. REVERSE: CNON_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 (Reasoning: If CNON (likely a compound of nitrogen and oxygen) is a product of CKNN, then the direction of the edge may be reversed. This reversal would reflect a more plausible causal direction based on chemical transformation processes.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment CBODN_12_15 -> CKNN_12_30: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR.

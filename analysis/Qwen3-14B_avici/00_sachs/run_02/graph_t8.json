First, the tentative note highlights uncertainty around the 'PIP3 \u2192 Akt' relationship, suggesting it may be a candidate for experimental validation. Second, the absence of a direct link from 'PIP3' to 'Erk' may be biologically plausible, as PIP3 can influence signaling pathways that indirectly affect Erk. Third, the lack of a direct link from 'PKA' to 'Jnk' may be worth exploring, as PKA is known to modulate multiple signaling cascades, including those involving Jnk. These three candidate operations\u2014validating PIP3 \u2192 Akt, adding PIP3 \u2192 Erk, and adding PKA \u2192 Jnk\u2014are proposed based on biological plausibility and the need for experimental confirmation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: PIP3 \u2192 Akt (Reasoning: The current graph assumes a direct causal link from PIP3 to Akt, but this relationship is not yet experimentally validated. If no effect is observed when PIP3 is manipulated while Akt is measured, this relationship may be spurious or mediated by other variables.)\n2. ADD: PIP3 \u2192 Erk (Reasoning: PIP3 is known to influence downstream signaling pathways, and Erk is a key effector in these pathways. Adding this link may better capture the direct or indirect influence of PIP3 on Erk, which is not currently represented in the graph.)\n3. ADD: PKA \u2192 Jnk (Reasoning: PKA is involved in modulating various signaling cascades, including those involving Jnk. While not currently represented in the graph, this direct influence is biologically plausible and should be tested.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment Raf -> Mek: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Plcg -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKC -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> PKC: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKC -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKC -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> PKC: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Erk -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Mek \u2192 Akt\n  P38 \u2192 Akt\n  PIP3 \u2192 Akt\n  PIP2 \u2192 Plcg\n  P38 \u2192 Plcg\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP3\n  PKC \u2192 P38\n  Erk \u2192 PKA\n  Akt \u2192 PKA\n  P38 \u2192 Jnk\n  PKC \u2192 Jnk\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -130803.87339866246\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -131211.8449, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'PIP3', 'Akt')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: PIP3\u2192Akt\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, there is no direct connection from Plcg to Akt, which may be missing. Based on domain knowledge, Akt is downstream of PIP3, and PIP3 is generated from PIP2 via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Therefore, adding an edge from PIP2 \u2192 Akt may be plausible if PIP2 indirectly influences Akt through PIP3. However, since PIP3 is not in the current graph, this remains uncertain. Instead, adding a direct edge from Plcg \u2192 Akt may be worth testing, but it was previously attempted and failed. A more strategic local refinement is to reverse the edge PKC \u2192 PKA, as PKA is known to inhibit PKC in some signaling pathways, and this reversal may better align with the causal dynamics.",

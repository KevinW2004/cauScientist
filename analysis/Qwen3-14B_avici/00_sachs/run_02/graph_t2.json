However, there are several potential missing or indirect relationships that could be refined. Based on the tentative notes, which confirm most of the existing edges, we focus on identifying candidate changes that may improve the model's accuracy and completeness. Here are three key areas for refinement:\n\n1. **Missing Edge: PIP3 \u2192 Akt**: PIP3 is a known activator of Akt through the PI3K-Akt pathway. While Akt is influenced by Mek and P38, PIP3 may directly influence Akt as well, which is not currently represented in the graph. Adding this edge would better reflect the biochemical mechanisms underlying Akt activation.\n\n2. **Missing Edge: Jnk \u2192 Erk**: Jnk and Erk are both members of the MAPK family and can influence each other in feedback loops. Although Erk is downstream of Mek, Jnk might have a direct influence on Erk, which is not currently represented. Adding this edge would help capture potential regulatory interactions between these kinases.\n\n3. **Reverse Edge: PKC \u2192 PIP2**: While PIP2 is an upstream regulator of Plcg, there is evidence that PKC can influence phospholipid metabolism, including PIP2 levels. If PKC has a direct effect on PIP2, the current edge (PIP2 \u2192 Plcg) might be indirect, and reversing the direction to PKC \u2192 PIP2 could better reflect the causal directionality.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PIP3 \u2192 Akt (Reasoning: PIP3 is a known activator of Akt through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Including this direct edge would better reflect the biochemical mechanism of Akt activation and improve the model's completeness.)\n2. ADD: Jnk \u2192 Erk (Reasoning: Jnk and Erk are both MAPK family members and may influence each other in feedback loops. Adding this edge would capture potential regulatory interactions between these kinases that are not currently represented.)\n3. REVERSE: PKC \u2192 PIP2 (Reasoning: PKC is involved in phospholipid metabolism, and there is evidence that it can influence PIP2 levels. Reversing the edge from PIP2 \u2192 Plcg to PKC \u2192 PIP2 may better reflect the causal directionality in phospholipid signaling.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment Raf -> Mek: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Plcg -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKC -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Mek \u2192 Akt\n  P38 \u2192 Akt\n  PIP2 \u2192 Plcg\n  P38 \u2192 Plcg\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP3\n  PKC \u2192 P38\n  Erk \u2192 PKA\n  Akt \u2192 PKA\n  P38 \u2192 Jnk\n  PKC \u2192 Jnk\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -131211.84485293197\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

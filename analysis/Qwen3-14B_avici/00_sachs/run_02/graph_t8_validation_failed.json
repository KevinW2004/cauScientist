For example, Plcg (Phospholipase C gamma) is known to generate PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and can also influence Akt through PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate) production. However, the direct edge from Plcg to Akt has previously failed, suggesting that an intermediate like PIP3 may be necessary. Adding the edge Plcg \u2192 PIP3 could better align the graph with known signaling pathways and improve the log-likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Plcg -> PIP2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  PKC \u2192 PKA\n  PKA \u2192 Jnk\n  PKA \u2192 P38\n  Erk \u2192 Akt\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP3\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP2\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -122272.41123418875\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -122277.9148, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'PIP3', 'Akt')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the sachs domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

Based on the tentative notes, the edge 'Plcg \u2192 PIP2' remains uncertain due to lack of interventional evidence, and the edge 'PKA \u2192 Jnk' is flagged for potential deletion due to possible spuriousness. Additionally, the absence of a direct edge from 'PKA' to 'Erk' may be a missing relationship given that PKA is known to influence multiple downstream pathways, including those involving Erk. These three candidate changes are prioritized for validation through targeted interventional experiments.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Raf -> Mek\n  - Mek -> Erk\n  - Erk -> Akt\n  - Akt -> PIP3\n  - Plcg -> PKC\n  - Plcg -> PKA\n  - PKA -> P38\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: PKA \u2192 Jnk (Reasoning: The edge 'PKA \u2192 Jnk' is flagged as potentially spurious. PKA is primarily known to influence pathways such as Erk and Akt, not Jnk. This relationship may be an artifact of correlation rather than a direct causal influence.)\n2. REVERSE: PIP2 \u2192 Plcg (Reasoning: The edge 'Plcg \u2192 PIP2' is tentative and lacks interventional support. Reversing the direction to 'PIP2 \u2192 Plcg' may be more consistent with biological knowledge, where PIP2 can influence PLC\u03b3 activity through phosphatidylinositol signaling.)\n3. ADD: PKA \u2192 Erk (Reasoning: PKA is known to influence Erk through the MAPK pathway, and the current graph only includes a pathway from Raf \u2192 Mek \u2192 Erk. Adding 'PKA \u2192 Erk' could better capture the full regulatory network of Erk.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment Plcg -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> Mek: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Akt -> PIP3: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Plcg: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Plcg: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Plcg: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Plcg: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Plcg: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Erk -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Plcg: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 4):\n  Plcg \u2192 PKC\n  Plcg \u2192 PKA\n  Raf \u2192 PKA\n  PKA \u2192 Jnk\n  PKA \u2192 P38\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Erk \u2192 Akt\n  Akt \u2192 PIP3\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP2\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -120542.45908715461\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -122359.4843, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'PKA', 'Jnk')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: PKA\u2192Jnk\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, based on domain knowledge, PIP2 is a direct product of Plcg activity, and PKC is activated by DAG, which is a byproduct of Plcg-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis. The edge Plcg \u2192 PKC may not be a direct causal relationship but rather an indirect one through DAG. Therefore, reversing this edge may better reflect the true causal mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Plcg -> PIP2\n  - Raf -> Mek\n  - Mek -> Erk\n  - Erk -> Akt\n  - Akt -> PIP3\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  PKC \u2192 Plcg\n  PKC \u2192 PKA\n  PKA \u2192 Jnk\n  PKA \u2192 P38\n  Plcg \u2192 Raf\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Erk \u2192 Akt\n  Akt \u2192 PIP3\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP2\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -119518.67063500617\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the sachs domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

PKA is typically activated by cAMP and influences downstream targets like CREB, but its direct activation of Jnk is less established. Given that previous attempts to delete or reverse this edge failed, it may be better to retain it tentatively while exploring other modifications. Instead, I will focus on adding a more strongly supported edge based on the known signaling cascade: Raf \u2192 Erk. Although the current graph has Raf \u2192 Mek and Mek \u2192 Erk, a direct Raf \u2192 Erk edge may capture additional regulatory mechanisms or parallel pathways.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Plcg -> PIP2\n  - Raf -> Mek\n  - Mek -> Erk\n  - Erk -> Akt\n  - PIP3 -> Akt\n  - PIP2 -> PIP3\n  - PIP2 -> PKC\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 4):\n  PIP2 \u2192 PKC\n  PKA \u2192 Jnk\n  PKA \u2192 P38\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Raf \u2192 Erk\n  Erk \u2192 Akt\n  PIP3 \u2192 Akt\n  PIP2 \u2192 PIP3\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP2\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -121701.42133691047\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the sachs domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

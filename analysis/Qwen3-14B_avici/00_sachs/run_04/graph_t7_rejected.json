While this edge has been retained due to previous failed attempts to remove it, the confirmed signaling relationships in the sachs domain suggest that Jnk is more likely to be influenced by upstream MAPK pathways, such as through the Jnk cascade itself or via P38. However, since the current graph already includes PKA \u2192 P38 and P38 is known to activate Jnk, it is plausible that Jnk activation via PKA may be indirect. Instead of removing the PKA \u2192 Jnk edge, I will focus on adding a more strongly supported edge based on known signaling: PIP3 \u2192 PKC.

Here are three candidate changes for refinement:\n\n1. **Add an edge from Erk to Jnk**: In some signaling contexts, Erk can feedback to regulate Jnk activity. This feedback may be absent in the current graph.\n\n2. **Delete the edge from Jnk to PKA**: There is no strong biological evidence to suggest that Jnk directly influences PKA activity. This edge may be an artifact of correlation without causation.\n\n3. **Reverse the edge from PIP3 to PIP2**: While PIP3 can be converted to PIP2 via phosphatases, the current graph assumes PIP3 \u2192 PIP2. This may be incorrect, as PIP2 is typically the precursor to PIP3, and PIP3 can be dephosphorylated back to PIP2, suggesting the direction should be reversed.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed below.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Erk \u2192 Jnk (Reasoning: Erk can exert feedback inhibition on Jnk in some signaling pathways, which is a known regulatory mechanism. Adding this edge would better represent potential regulatory loops in the sachs network.)\n2. DELETE: Jnk \u2192 PKA (Reasoning: There is no clear evidence of a direct causal influence of Jnk on PKA in the sachs signaling network. This edge may be based on correlation rather than causation and should be removed.)\n3. REVERSE: PIP2 \u2192 PIP3 (Reasoning: PIP2 is typically the precursor to PIP3, and PIP3 can be dephosphorylated back to PIP2. The current edge PIP3 \u2192 PIP2 may be incorrectly directed and should be reversed to reflect the true biochemical direction.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment Raf -> Mek: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Erk -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> PIP3: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Akt -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> PIP3: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Erk -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> PKA: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> PIP3: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  PKC \u2192 Plcg\n  PIP3 \u2192 PKC\n  Jnk \u2192 PKA\n  PIP3 \u2192 PKA\n  PIP3 \u2192 Jnk\n  PKC \u2192 Raf\n  Mek \u2192 Raf\n  PKC \u2192 Mek\n  PIP3 \u2192 Mek\n  Raf \u2192 Erk\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Akt \u2192 PIP3\n  Akt \u2192 PIP2\n  PIP3 \u2192 PIP2\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -132932.7996036947\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -132935.0217, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'PIP3', 'PIP2')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -134092.3522, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Jnk', 'PKA')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: Jnk\u2192PKA; REVERSE: PIP3\u2192PIP2\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

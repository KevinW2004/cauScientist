The most pressing issue is the uncertain directionality of the Jnk \u2192 P38 relationship, as noted in the tentative notes. Additionally, there are potential missing or reversed edges based on known biological mechanisms in the sachs domain. For example, PIP2 and PIP3 are phosphoinositides that often interact in signaling pathways, and there may be a feedback mechanism or direct influence from PIP3 to PIP2 that is currently unaccounted for. Another candidate for reversal is the PKC \u2192 Akt edge, as Akt is a well-known downstream effector of multiple pathways, including those involving PIP3, and it is plausible that Akt may influence PKC in some feedback loops.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: P38 \u2192 Jnk (Reasoning: The current edge Jnk \u2192 P38 is uncertain due to a lack of interventional evidence. Reversing this edge to P38 \u2192 Jnk may better align with known stress response pathways where P38 can influence Jnk activity.)\n2. ADD: PIP3 \u2192 PIP2 (Reasoning: PIP3 and PIP2 are closely related phosphoinositides, and there is evidence in signaling pathways that PIP3 can be converted back to PIP2 through phosphatases. This suggests a potential direct influence from PIP3 to PIP2 that may be missing in the current graph.)\n3. REVERSE: Akt \u2192 PKC (Reasoning: While PKC is known to influence Akt, Akt is also involved in feedback regulation of PKC in some contexts. Reversing the edge to Akt \u2192 PKC may reflect a more accurate representation of potential downstream regulatory effects.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment Raf -> Mek: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Plcg -> PIP3: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Akt -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment P38 -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment P38 -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKC -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Akt -> PKC: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  PIP2 \u2192 Plcg\n  PKC \u2192 PIP2\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP3\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Akt \u2192 Erk\n  PIP3 \u2192 Akt\n  PKC \u2192 Akt\n  Erk \u2192 PKA\n  Akt \u2192 PKA\n  PKC \u2192 P38\n  Jnk \u2192 P38\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -128492.31856203843\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

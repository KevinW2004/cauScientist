Plcg primarily affects PIP2 by hydrolyzing it into IP3 and DAG, which in turn activates PKC. Thus, the direct edge from Plcg to PKC may be an indirect inference. Reversing this edge to 'PKC \u2192 Plcg' is not biologically plausible, but removing it and adding a more direct pathway (e.g., DAG \u2192 PKC) would better align with known signaling cascades. However, since DAG is not in the current variable list, we will instead remove the edge 'Plcg \u2192 PKC' and keep the existing 'Plcg \u2192 PIP2' and 'PIP2 \u2192 PIP3' edges, which are well-supported by domain knowledge.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Plcg -> PIP2\n  - PIP2 -> PIP3\n  - Raf -> Mek\n  - Mek -> Erk\n  - Erk -> Akt\n  - PIP3 -> Akt\n  - PKA -> Jnk\n  - PKA -> P38\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  PKC \u2192 PKA\n  PKA \u2192 Jnk\n  PKA \u2192 P38\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Erk \u2192 Akt\n  PIP3 \u2192 Akt\n  PIP2 \u2192 PIP3\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP2\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -119473.85659733234\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Plcg \u2192 PKC not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the sachs domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

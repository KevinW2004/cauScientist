Based on the tentative notes, the directionality of Jnk \u2192 P38 is uncertain, and further experimental validation is required. Additionally, there are potential missing or reversed edges that may improve the accuracy of the causal structure. For example, the influence of PIP2 on Akt is not currently represented, and the influence of Erk on Jnk is also missing. These could be important for capturing the full causal network. To validate these hypotheses, interventional experiments are needed.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: P38 \u2192 Jnk (Reasoning: The directionality of the Jnk \u2192 P38 relationship is uncertain. It is possible that P38 influences Jnk, which would be a reversal of the current edge. This reversal should be tested experimentally.)\n2. ADD: PIP2 \u2192 Akt (Reasoning: PIP2 is a precursor to PIP3, and PIP3 is known to influence Akt. Given the role of PIP2 in lipid signaling, it is plausible that PIP2 also directly influences Akt, possibly through a parallel pathway or earlier in the signaling cascade.)\n3. ADD: Erk \u2192 Jnk (Reasoning: Erk is a downstream effector of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and Jnk is part of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway. There is potential for cross-talk between these pathways, and Erk could influence Jnk either directly or through shared signaling intermediates.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment Raf -> Mek: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Plcg -> PIP3: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Akt -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment P38 -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Erk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKA -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment P38 -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Raf -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PKC -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP3 -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Akt -> PKC: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Akt -> PKC: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Plcg -> PIP2: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Jnk -> P38: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PIP2 -> Akt: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Erk -> Jnk: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  Raf \u2192 Mek\n  PIP2 \u2192 Plcg\n  PKC \u2192 PIP2\n  Plcg \u2192 PIP3\n  Mek \u2192 Erk\n  Akt \u2192 Erk\n  PIP3 \u2192 Akt\n  PKC \u2192 Akt\n  Erk \u2192 PKA\n  Akt \u2192 PKA\n  PKC \u2192 P38\n  Jnk \u2192 P38\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -128492.31856203843\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -128501.4548, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Jnk', 'P38')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge Akt \u2192 PKC not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: Akt\u2192PKC; REVERSE: Jnk\u2192P38\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

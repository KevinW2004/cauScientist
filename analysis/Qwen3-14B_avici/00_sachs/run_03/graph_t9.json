Given that Plcg is a key phospholipase involved in signaling through PIP2 and PIP3, it is plausible that Plcg could also influence Akt, which is downstream of PIP3. However, adding Plcg\u2192Akt directly has previously failed, so we instead consider adding a more indirect but plausible edge: Plcg \u2192 PIP3. This would align with the known biochemical pathway where Plcg hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate PIP3, which in turn activates Akt.

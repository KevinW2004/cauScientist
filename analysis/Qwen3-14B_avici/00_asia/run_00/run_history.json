However, given the domain context of tuberculosis diagnosis, it is plausible that 'bronc' (bronchitis) and 'lung' (lung cancer) are more direct causes of 'dysp' (dyspnea), while 'either' is a logical disjunction of 'tub' and 'lung'. Therefore, it may be more accurate to reverse the edge from 'either \u2192 dysp' to 'dysp \u2192 either', reflecting that dyspnea might be a symptom that contributes to the determination of 'either' (i.e., the presence of either tuberculosis or lung cancer). This reversal aligns with the idea that dyspnea could be a downstream effect of the disease, but also a factor in diagnosing it.",

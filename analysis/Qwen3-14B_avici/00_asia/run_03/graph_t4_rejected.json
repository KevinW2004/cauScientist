However, based on domain knowledge, it is also possible that bronchitis could influence the likelihood of dyspnea independently of 'either'. While the current edge 'bronc \u2192 dysp' is present, it might be beneficial to confirm whether this relationship is direct and independent of other factors like 'either'.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

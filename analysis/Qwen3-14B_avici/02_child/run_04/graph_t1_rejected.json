Here are three candidate changes that could refine the causal model:\n\n1. **Add an edge from 'DuctFlow' to 'CardiacMixing'**: Ductal flow is a key determinant of cardiac mixing in neonates, especially in the context of congenital heart disease or asphyxia. If ductal flow is impaired, it can directly affect the degree of cardiac mixing, which is a central component of the graph. This relationship may be missing in the current model.\n\n2. **Delete the edge from 'Disease' to 'LVH'**: While disease may be a risk factor for LVH, LVH is a specific pathology that may be more directly caused by 'BirthAsphyxia' or other physiological factors, rather than being a direct consequence of a general 'Disease' variable. This edge may be overgeneralized and not directly causal.\n\n3. **Reverse the edge from 'Grunting' to 'GruntingReport'**: Grunting is a clinical sign that is typically reported by clinicians, not the other way around. The report is a representation of the grunting behavior, not the cause of it. This edge is likely reversed and should be corrected.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: DuctFlow \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: Ductal flow is a physiological mechanism that directly influences cardiac mixing. If the ductus arteriosus is open or closed, it affects the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart.)\n2. DELETE: Disease \u2192 LVH (Reasoning: LVH may be more directly caused by 'BirthAsphyxia' or other physiological variables, rather than being a direct consequence of a general 'Disease' variable, which is a high-level category and may not directly cause LVH.)\n3. REVERSE: GruntingReport \u2192 Grunting (Reasoning: Grunting is a clinical sign that is observed and reported, not the other way around. The report is a dependent variable of the grunting behavior, not its cause.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.0786). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['XrayReport'], do(LVH) affects LVHreport (avg_TVD=0.1636). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LungFlow', 'LowerBodyO2'], do(HypoxiaInO2) affects CO2 (avg_TVD=0.2093). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'Disease']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(DuctFlow) affects CardiacMixing (TVD=0.0630). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'Age']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(Disease) affects LVH (TVD=0.1050). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Sick'], do(GruntingReport) affects Grunting (avg_TVD=0.0024).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

HypDistrib (hypoxia distribution) is more likely a systemic consequence of CardiacMixing and HypoxiaInO2, which are driven by Disease. This systemic hypoxia can then influence LungParench (lung parenchymal function). Reversing the edge from HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench to LungParench \u2192 HypDistrib may not be valid based on prior failures. Instead, we should explore removing the HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench edge and adding a direct edge from HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 HypDistrib, as HypoxiaInO2 is a more direct driver of hypoxia distribution. This would better reflect the causal pathway from Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 HypDistrib \u2192 Sick, aligning with known mechanisms of congenital heart disease.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> CardiacMixing\n  - CardiacMixing -> HypoxiaInO2\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> LowerBodyO2\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> RUQO2\n  - Disease -> LungFlow\n  - LungFlow -> LungParench\n  - LungParench -> ChestXray\n  - HypDistrib -> ChestXray\n  - HypDistrib -> Sick\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> Sick\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 11):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 RUQO2\n  Disease \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  HypDistrib \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Sick\n  HypDistrib \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -133247.82732120695\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -133294.6502, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypoxiaInO2', 'HypDistrib')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 HypDistrib not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

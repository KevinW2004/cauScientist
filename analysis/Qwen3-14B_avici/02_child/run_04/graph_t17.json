This suggests that the direct causal influence of LungParench on HypoxiaInO2 may not be valid if Disease or LungFlow act as confounders. To refine the graph, we should consider: (1) removing the edge 'LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2' if it is confounded, (2) adding a direct edge from LungFlow to HypoxiaInO2 if it is a mediator, and (3) adding an edge from Disease to HypoxiaInO2 if it is a confounder. These changes would improve the accuracy of the causal model by addressing potential hidden confounding and indirect pathways.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The edge 'LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2' is tentative due to potential confounding by Disease and LungFlow. If LungParench's effect on HypoxiaInO2 is only indirect through these variables, the direct edge may be spurious.)\n2. ADD: LungFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: LungFlow may directly influence HypoxiaInO2 by affecting oxygen exchange in the lungs, and its inclusion could explain the observed relationship between LungParench and HypoxiaInO2.)\n3. ADD: Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Disease may be a confounder of the relationship between LungParench and HypoxiaInO2, as it can independently affect both variables. Adding this edge would help disentangle direct and confounded influences.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'CardiacMixing'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.2010).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

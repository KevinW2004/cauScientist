However, the failed attempt to directly add CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib suggests that the system may not accept direct edges from CardiacMixing to HypDistrib. Instead, we can test reversing the existing edge from LungParench \u2192 HypDistrib to HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench, which may better reflect the causal influence of systemic hypoxia distribution on lung parenchymal function. This change aligns with the idea that abnormal oxygen distribution can impact lung function, rather than the other way around.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> CardiacMixing\n  - CardiacMixing -> HypoxiaInO2\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> LowerBodyO2\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> RUQO2\n  - Disease -> LungFlow\n  - LungFlow -> LungParench\n  - LungParench -> ChestXray\n  - HypDistrib -> ChestXray\n  - HypDistrib -> Sick\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> Sick\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 RUQO2\n  Disease \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  HypDistrib \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Sick\n  HypDistrib \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -133285.8365319912\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -133304.0249, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HypDistrib', 'LungParench')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench or LungParench \u2192 HypDistrib not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

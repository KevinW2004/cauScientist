Here are the key considerations:\n\n1. **LVHreport** is a report of **LVH**, which is a clinical observation. It is likely that **LVHreport** is a downstream effect of **LVH**, but it may also depend on other factors such as **Disease** or **XrayReport**, which are also clinical reports. Adding **LVHreport \u2192 Disease** may be necessary to reflect the diagnostic influence of the report on the disease classification.\n\n2. **HypoxiaInO2** and **CO2** are both physiological measures that influence **HypDistrib**, but **HypDistrib** is a clinical report. It is possible that **HypDistrib** is influenced by **XrayReport** or **GruntingReport**, which are also reports. Adding **XrayReport \u2192 HypDistrib** may better capture the diagnostic process.\n\n3. **LungParench** has a strong influence on **LungFlow**, **ChestXray**, and **RUQO2**, but **LungFlow** could also influence **LungParench** in a feedback loop (e.g., poor flow may lead to worsening lung parenchyma). However, the current graph assumes a unidirectional relationship. Reversing **LungFlow \u2192 LungParench** could better represent the potential for lung parenchyma to be affected by flow dynamics.\n\nFor each proposed change, an interventional experiment is designed to test the causal influence directly.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LVHreport \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: LVHreport is a clinical observation that may influence the diagnosis of Disease, as it is used by clinicians to inform their assessment of the patient's condition.)\n2. ADD: XrayReport \u2192 HypDistrib (Reasoning: XrayReport is a clinical report that may influence the interpretation of HypDistrib, as it provides visual evidence that could affect the clinician's judgment of hypoxia distribution.)\n3. REVERSE: LungParench \u2192 LungFlow (Reasoning: LungFlow may influence the state of LungParench, as poor flow can lead to deterioration of lung tissue, suggesting a feedback mechanism that may not be fully captured by the current unidirectional relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LVH', 'HypoxiaInO2'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.2239).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HypDistrib\u2192Disease; DELETE: LungParench\u2192CO2, LungParench\u2192ChestXray; REVERSE: LungParench\u2192HypoxiaInO2\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

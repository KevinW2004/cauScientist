This suggests that the edge should be deleted. Additionally, the current graph lacks explicit causal links between HypDistrib and Disease, and between HypoxiaInO2 and Grunting, which may be important for capturing the full causal structure. These candidate changes aim to refine the graph based on both domain knowledge and interventional evidence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship between LungParench and LowerBodyO2 is likely indirect or spurious. Interventional evidence showed no significant effect of LungParench on LowerBodyO2, which supports the deletion of this edge.)\n2. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypDistrib is a downstream effect of multiple physiological variables (CardiacMixing, CO2, LowerBodyO2) and may directly contribute to the development of Disease. Adding this edge would better reflect the potential causal pathway from systemic hypoxia and perfusion patterns to disease manifestation.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Grunting (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a key indicator of oxygenation status and is likely to directly influence Grunting, which is a clinical sign of respiratory distress. This edge would capture the direct causal effect of hypoxia on the observed clinical behavior of Grunting.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LVH', 'HypoxiaInO2'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.2239).

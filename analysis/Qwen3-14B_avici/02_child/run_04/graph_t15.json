Additionally, we observe that 'LungParench' is connected to multiple variables, including 'CO2', 'RUQO2', and 'HypoxiaInO2', which are all related to hypoxia and gas exchange. This suggests that 'LungParench' may have a direct influence on 'LowerBodyO2' through shared physiological pathways, but the tentative note indicates that this may not be a direct causal relationship. Therefore, we propose to delete the edge. We also consider adding a direct edge from 'HypoxiaInO2' to 'Sick' based on the biological plausibility that hypoxia directly contributes to illness severity. Lastly, we suspect that 'CardiacMixing' may directly influence 'LowerBodyO2', as cardiac mixing affects oxygen distribution, and this relationship is not currently represented in the graph.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship between 'LungParench' and 'LowerBodyO2' is likely indirect or spurious. Interventional evidence has shown no significant effect, suggesting this edge should be removed.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Sick (Reasoning: Hypoxia is a strong contributor to illness severity. It is biologically plausible that 'HypoxiaInO2' directly influences 'Sick', and this relationship is not currently represented in the graph.)\n3. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: Cardiac mixing affects the distribution of oxygenated blood throughout the body, including the lower body. Therefore, it is plausible that 'CardiacMixing' directly influences 'LowerBodyO2', a relationship not currently represented.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LVH', 'HypoxiaInO2'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.2239).

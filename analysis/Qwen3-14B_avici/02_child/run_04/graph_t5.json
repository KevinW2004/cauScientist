Both are currently not confirmed in the current causal graph. Additionally, there is a missing relationship between HypoxiaInO2 and LungParench, which may be important for understanding how hypoxia affects lung structure. These three relationships are prioritized for refinement. To verify these, targeted interventional experiments are proposed.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that marginal evidence does not confirm a direct causal relationship between HypoxiaInO2 and CO2. This suggests that the edge may be spurious or indirect, and its removal would simplify the graph and improve accuracy.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Hypoxia is a known risk factor for lung parenchymal damage, and the absence of this edge may be an oversight. Adding this edge would better capture the potential causal pathway from hypoxia to lung structure.)\n3. ADD: LungParench \u2192 LungFlow (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates marginal evidence for this edge (TVD=0.0588), suggesting the relationship may be weak or mediated by other variables. Adding the edge would allow for further testing and refinement of the model.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'CardiacMixing'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.2010).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

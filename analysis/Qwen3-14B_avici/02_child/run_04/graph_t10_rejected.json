This suggests that the direction of causality might be reversed or that the relationship is not direct. Additionally, we suspect that LungFlow may influence both HypoxiaInO2 and LungParench, potentially confounding their relationship. We also note that CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 is present, but there is no explicit link from CardiacMixing to LungParench, which may be important for understanding the full causal structure. Finally, we suspect that HypoxiaInO2 may influence LungFlow, which is currently not represented in the graph.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The tentative edge from HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench may be confounded by Disease and LungFlow. Reversing the direction would better reflect the possibility that LungParench influences HypoxiaInO2, particularly in the context of lung pathology.)\n2. ADD: LungParench \u2192 LungFlow (Reasoning: LungParench (lung parenchymal disease) is likely to affect LungFlow (lung function or airflow). Adding this edge would account for the potential influence of lung parenchymal disease on airflow dynamics.)\n3. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Cardiac mixing (e.g., due to ductal shunting) may influence lung parenchymal disease, either through increased pulmonary blood flow or hypoxia. Including this relationship would better represent the full causal pathway from cardiac dysfunction to lung disease.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'CardiacMixing'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.2010).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

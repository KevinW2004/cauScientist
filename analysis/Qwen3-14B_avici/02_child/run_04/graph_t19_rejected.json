This suggests that the direct edge LungParench \u2192 Sick may not exist and should be evaluated. Additionally, there may be unexplored causal relationships between LungParench and HypoxiaInO2, and between HypoxiaInO2 and LungFlow, which could be refined for better accuracy. Finally, the relationship between HypoxiaInO2 and CO2 may be more direct than currently modeled, and should be confirmed.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease \u2192 LVH\n  - Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  - Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  - CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  - HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench\n  - CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  - LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  - HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  - HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 RUQO2\n  - HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungFlow\n  - HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Grunting\n  - LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n  - Disease \u2192 Sick\n  - HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Sick\n  - CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  - LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  - HypDistrib \u2192 ChestXray\n  - ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  - Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  - LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 Sick (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the link between LungParench and Sick may be indirect or mediated by other variables like HypoxiaInO2 or Grunting. Removing this edge would allow us to test whether the effect of LungParench on Sick is actually mediated or direct.)\n2. ADD: LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: LungParench (lung parenchymal disease) may directly contribute to HypoxiaInO2 (hypoxia in oxygen), which is a key driver of downstream outcomes. This relationship is not currently present and may improve the causal structure.)\n3. REVERSE: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungFlow (Reasoning: The current graph assumes HypoxiaInO2 causes LungFlow, but it is possible that LungFlow (lung flow) influences HypoxiaInO2, particularly if impaired lung function leads to hypoxia. Reversing this edge would allow us to test for this possibility.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.0786).

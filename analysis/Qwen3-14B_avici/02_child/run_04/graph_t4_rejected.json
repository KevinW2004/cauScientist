However, the failed attempt to directly add CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib suggests that the system may not accept direct edges from CardiacMixing to HypDistrib. Instead, we can test reversing the existing edge from LungParench \u2192 HypDistrib to HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench, which may better reflect the causal influence of systemic hypoxia distribution on lung parenchymal function.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

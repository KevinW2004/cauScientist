This relationship is biologically plausible and was previously attempted but failed due to invalid operations. Now, we can explore adding a new edge that connects HypDistrib to another variable that may be influenced by it, such as LowerBodyO2 or RUQO2, which are measures of oxygenation in specific body regions. This would help capture the downstream effects of hypoxia distribution and improve the graph's likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CardiacMixing -> LungFlow\n  - CardiacMixing -> HypoxiaInO2\n  - Disease -> DuctFlow\n  - Disease -> CardiacMixing\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 15):\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  HypDistrib \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungFlow\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -138819.97885803436\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

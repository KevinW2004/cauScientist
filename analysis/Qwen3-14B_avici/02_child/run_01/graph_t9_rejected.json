However, there are several relationships that may not be fully captured or may be misrepresented. Based on the variables and the tentative note supporting CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2, I will focus on refining the graph around disease-related variables and their downstream effects on physiological outcomes, as well as the role of diagnostic reports in reflecting underlying conditions. I propose three candidate changes: adding a direct link from Disease to HypoxiaInO2, adding a link from Disease to LungParench, and reversing the direction of CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 to HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing (though the note supports the current direction, it is worth testing). For each, I design an interventional experiment to verify the causal direction.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Disease may directly affect oxygenation, potentially bypassing CardiacMixing. Adding this edge would capture a direct physiological pathway from disease to hypoxia.)\n2. ADD: Disease \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Disease may directly affect lung parenchyma, especially in neonatal contexts. This would better reflect the impact of disease on lung structure.)\n3. REVERSE: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: While the current edge is supported, reversing it would test whether hypoxia influences cardiac mixing, which might be a feedback mechanism or a misrepresentation of causality.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LungParench'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.0615).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

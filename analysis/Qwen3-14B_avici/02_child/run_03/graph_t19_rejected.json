First, the edge 'Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2' is questioned because there is no significant effect observed, which could indicate that Disease influences HypoxiaInO2 indirectly through other variables, or that the relationship is not direct. Second, 'LVHreport \u2192 Sick' is suspected to be spurious, as LVHreport is a report of LVH, not LVH itself, and may not directly cause sickness. Third, 'LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2' is also under question, as the marginal evidence suggests it may not be a direct causal link. To verify these, we propose targeted interventions and conditioning sets that isolate the causal effect of each relationship.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Marginal evidence suggests no significant effect of Disease on HypoxiaInO2, indicating the link may be spurious or mediated by other variables. Removing this edge would help refine the graph to reflect more accurate direct causal relationships.)\n2. DELETE: LVHreport \u2192 Sick (Reasoning: LVHreport is a report of LVH, not the condition itself. The lack of significant effect suggests this link is likely spurious or mediated by other factors, such as LVH itself or other disease-related variables.)\n3. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The marginal evidence suggests no significant effect of LungParench on HypoxiaInO2, which may indicate a spurious or mediated relationship. Removing this edge could better align the graph with observed data.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LVHreport'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.1220).

Reversing this edge would better reflect the causal direction supported by the data.\",\n  \"confirmed_edges\": [],\n  \"edge_notes\": {\n    \"CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\": \"This edge is supported by interventional evidence and domain knowledge, but its direction should be re-evaluated.\"\n  },\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n      \"parent\": \"CardiacMixing\",\n      \"child\": \"HypoxiaInO2\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Interventional evidence suggests that HypoxiaInO2 is not directly caused by CardiacMixing.

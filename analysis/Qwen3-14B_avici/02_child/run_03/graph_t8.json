However, there are several other relationships that may be missing or incorrectly represented in the current graph. For example, 'Disease' may have a direct effect on 'LVH', which could explain why 'LVHreport' is present. Additionally, 'HypoxiaInO2' may directly influence 'Grunting', and 'LowerBodyO2' or 'RUQO2' may be important mediators of 'HypoxiaInO2'. I propose three candidate operations to refine the graph and design targeted experiments to test these relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Disease \u2192 LVH (Reasoning: If 'Disease' directly causes 'LVH', this would explain the presence of 'LVHreport' and provide a clearer causal pathway from 'Disease' to 'LVHreport'. This would also help in understanding the mechanisms of disease progression.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Grunting (Reasoning: Given that 'HypDistrib' influences 'Grunting', and 'HypoxiaInO2' is a key factor in hypoxia, it is plausible that 'HypoxiaInO2' directly influences 'Grunting' as well. This would add a more direct causal link between hypoxia and clinical signs of respiratory distress.)\n3. ADD: LowerBodyO2 \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Since 'LowerBodyO2' is a measure of oxygenation in a specific region, it may directly influence 'HypoxiaInO2', which is a global measure of hypoxia. This would provide a more complete picture of how regional oxygen levels affect overall hypoxia.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'Disease'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.1127).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nREVERSE: Disease\u2192DuctFlow\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

First, the variable 'BirthAsphyxia' is a known risk factor for neonatal complications such as hypoxia, lung disease, and cardiac issues, but it is not connected to any other variables in the graph. This suggests that it should be added as a parent to variables like HypoxiaInO2, LungParench, and possibly Disease. Second, 'LVHreport' is a reported measure of LVH, but it may be influenced by the XrayReport or other diagnostic tools like ChestXray, which are already in the graph. Third, 'DuctFlow' is influenced by Disease, but it may also be directly influenced by CardiacMixing, which affects blood flow dynamics. These three candidate operations aim to refine the causal structure to better reflect clinical and physiological relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: BirthAsphyxia \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Birth asphyxia is a known cause of hypoxia, and thus should directly influence HypoxiaInO2.)\n2. ADD: ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: ChestXray is a diagnostic tool that can be used to detect LVH, so it may directly influence LVHreport.)\n3. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 DuctFlow (Reasoning: Cardiac mixing can affect ductal flow, so this direct influence should be considered.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'Disease'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.1127). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(LVH) affects LVHreport (TVD=0.1092). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['DuctFlow', 'HypDistrib'], do(LungFlow) affects CardiacMixing (avg_TVD=0.0610). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'CO2', 'Age']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (TVD=0.0336). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVH', 'XrayReport', 'Age']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(ChestXray) affects LVHreport (TVD=0.0378). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'CO2', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

These are: (1) Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2, (2) LVHreport \u2192 Sick, and (3) LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2. Each of these is a candidate for removal (DELETE) as they may not represent direct causal relationships. To verify these, we propose targeted interventional experiments that isolate the variables in question and observe their effects on the target variable. This will help determine whether the relationships are direct or spurious.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 may not be a direct causal link and could be mediated or spurious. Removing this edge would allow us to test if HypoxiaInO2 is directly caused by other variables, such as CardiacMixing.)\n2. DELETE: LVHreport \u2192 Sick (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that LVHreport \u2192 Sick may be spurious or mediated. This edge may not represent a direct causal influence of LVHreport on Sick, and removing it would help clarify the actual pathways from LVHreport to Sick, potentially through other variables like Disease or CardiacMixing.)\n3. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 may not be a direct causal link. This relationship may be spurious or mediated by other variables like CardiacMixing. Removing it would allow us to better assess the true causes of HypoxiaInO2.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LVHreport'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.1220).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

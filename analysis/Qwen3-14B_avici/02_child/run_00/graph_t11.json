Therefore, we should consider whether Disease \u2192 LVH is a direct causal relationship or if it is indirect. Additionally, the current graph lacks a direct link from Disease to LVH, and it is plausible that Disease might directly influence LVH. Furthermore, the relationship between HypoxiaInO2 and CO2 is not explicitly modeled, which could be important given their shared physiological relevance. Lastly, the graph does not model a potential influence of LungParench on LungFlow, which could be a direct causal link.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Disease \u2192 LVH (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that Disease may directly influence LVH, and adding this edge would allow for better modeling of the causal pathway from Disease to LVH, independent of mediators like CardiacMixing or LVHreport.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2 (Reasoning: Hypoxia and CO2 levels are physiologically related. Adding this edge would reflect the potential causal influence of hypoxia on CO2 levels, which is not currently modeled in the graph.)\n3. ADD: LungParench \u2192 LungFlow (Reasoning: LungParench (lung parenchymal changes) could directly affect LungFlow (lung airflow). Adding this edge would better capture the physiological relationship between lung structure and function.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Disease', 'Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.0877).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

First, the variable 'Disease' is connected to 'DuctFlow', but there is no explicit connection from 'Disease' to 'HypoxiaInO2' or 'LVH', which may be important given that disease can affect both oxygenation and cardiac structure. Second, 'LVHreport' is not currently connected to any other variables, which may be an oversight, as LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) is a measurable outcome that could be influenced by 'LVH' and potentially affect 'Sick'. Third, 'HypDistrib' is not connected to any other variables, but it represents hypoxia distribution, which could influence 'LungParench' or 'CardiacMixing'. These three candidate changes aim to refine the graph by adding missing relationships that are logically and clinically plausible.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Disease can directly influence oxygenation, which is captured by HypoxiaInO2. This connection is clinically plausible and would better represent the impact of disease on systemic oxygen levels.)\n2. ADD: LVH \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: LVHreport is likely a reported or measured outcome of LVH. Adding this edge reflects the direct relationship between the condition and its clinical report.)\n3. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: HypDistrib, representing the distribution of hypoxia, could influence lung parenchymal changes. This edge aligns with the physiological understanding that uneven hypoxia distribution can lead to regional lung damage.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.0811).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: Disease\u2192Sick; DELETE: HypoxiaInO2\u2192CO2; REVERSE: HypoxiaInO2\u2192CO2, Grunting\u2192GruntingReport\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

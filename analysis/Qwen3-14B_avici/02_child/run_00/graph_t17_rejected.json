However, this may not be a direct relationship but could be mediated by other variables such as BirthAsphyxia or CardiacMixing. To better understand the causal structure, we consider three candidate changes: (1) adding a direct edge from Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing, (2) reversing the edge from HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing to CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2, and (3) deleting the edge from Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2. These changes are motivated by the possibility of unmeasured confounding, feedback loops, or indirect pathways that may not be fully captured in the current model. Each proposed change is supported by domain knowledge and can be tested through targeted interventional experiments.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: Disease may directly influence CardiacMixing, especially in the context of congenital heart defects or other pathologies. This relationship could be a missing direct pathway in the current graph.)\n2. REVERSE: CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: CardiacMixing may influence HypoxiaInO2, rather than the other way around. For example, poor cardiac mixing can lead to hypoxia, suggesting a potential reversal of the current edge.)\n3. DELETE: Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The edge from Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 may be indirect, mediated by other variables such as CardiacMixing or LungParench. Removing this edge would help clarify the true causal structure.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.0811).

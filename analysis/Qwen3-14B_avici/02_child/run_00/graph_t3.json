BirthAsphyxia is a condition that occurs at birth and may influence early physiological markers such as HypoxiaInO2 and CO2. Disease, as a root cause, likely influences multiple downstream variables such as DuctFlow, CardiacMixing, and possibly LVH. CardiacMixing affects oxygenation, which in turn influences HypoxiaInO2 and may affect LungParenchyma. LungParenchyma and LungFlow could influence oxygen levels in different body regions (e.g., LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2). CO2 levels may be reported as CO2Report, and ChestXray findings are likely reported as XrayReport. Grunting and GruntingReport are likely symptoms or signs of respiratory distress. Age is a root variable that may influence disease progression or presentation. LVH is a structural finding that is reported as LVHreport. HypDistrib may be a downstream effect of CardiacMixing or HypoxiaInO2. Disease may also influence Sick status. All relationships are based on domain knowledge and must be acyclic to ensure the graph is a DAG.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungParench \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  HypDistrib \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Sick\n  LungParench \u2192 Sick\n  HypDistrib \u2192 Sick\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -130354.79537527244\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -130366.1762, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HypoxiaInO2', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -130473.3893, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LungFlow', 'HypoxiaInO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

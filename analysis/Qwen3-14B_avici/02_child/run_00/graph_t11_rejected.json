This suggests the need to explore whether 'HypDistrib' is a mediator or a confounder. Additionally, 'HypoxiaInO2' and 'LowerBodyO2' are both related to oxygenation, so there may be a direct relationship between them. Similarly, 'LungParench' (lung parenchymal findings) may influence 'LungFlow', which is a logical causal pathway. These three relationships\u2014'HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2', 'HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2', and 'LungParench \u2192 LungFlow'\u2014are strong candidates for addition or confirmation based on domain knowledge and the existing causal structure.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that 'CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2' may be mediated by 'HypDistrib', suggesting a potential direct influence of 'HypDistrib' on 'HypoxiaInO2'. Adding this edge would better capture the full causal mechanism.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: Both variables are related to oxygenation levels in different body regions. A direct causal influence from 'HypoxiaInO2' to 'LowerBodyO2' is plausible based on physiological understanding.)\n3. ADD: LungParench \u2192 LungFlow (Reasoning: Lung parenchymal abnormalities are expected to impact lung flow dynamics, making this a plausible direct causal relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LungParench', 'Age'], do(CardiacMixing) affects HypDistrib (avg_TVD=0.0545).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

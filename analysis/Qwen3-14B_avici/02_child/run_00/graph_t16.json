This suggests that HypDistrib may be an intermediate variable in this causal chain. Therefore, we consider adding HypDistrib as a mediator between CardiacMixing and HypoxiaInO2. Additionally, we suspect that CardiacMixing might influence HypDistrib directly, and that HypDistrib may also influence LungParench, given the presence of other variables related to oxygenation and lung function. Finally, we consider the possibility that Disease may directly influence LungParench, as it is a general indicator of health status and may affect lung development or function.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib (Reasoning: The note suggests that CardiacMixing may influence HypoxiaInO2 either directly or via HypDistrib. Adding CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib allows us to test whether this mediation is present.)\n2. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: If HypDistrib is a mediator between CardiacMixing and HypoxiaInO2, then we should explicitly model this relationship to better understand the causal pathway.)\n3. ADD: Disease \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Disease is a broad indicator of health, and LungParench is a measure of lung parenchyma. It is plausible that Disease directly influences LungParench, especially in the context of neonatal health.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LungParench', 'Age'], do(CardiacMixing) affects HypDistrib (avg_TVD=0.0545).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CardiacMixing\u2192HypDistrib, HypDistrib\u2192HypoxiaInO2, DuctFlow\u2192CardiacMixing, Disease\u2192HypDistrib, HypDistrib\u2192HypoxiaInO2, LowerBodyO2\u2192HypoxiaInO2\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

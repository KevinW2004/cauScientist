Additionally, the graph lacks explicit connections involving LVH, Disease, and DuctFlow, which may be critical for capturing full causal relationships in neonatal care. Finally, there is no direct link between HypDistrib and Disease, which might be important for understanding systemic hypoxia and disease progression. I propose three candidate operations to refine the graph: (1) delete the spurious edge LVHreport \u2192 LVH, (2) add a direct edge from DuctFlow \u2192 Disease, and (3) add a direct edge from HypDistrib \u2192 Disease. For each, I design an interventional experiment to confirm the proposed change.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVHreport \u2192 LVH (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the edge LVHreport \u2192 LVH is likely spurious, as no significant effect was observed when intervening on LVHreport. This suggests that LVHreport does not directly cause LVH, and the relationship may be confounded or based on reverse causation.)\n2. ADD: DuctFlow \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: Ductal patency (DuctFlow) is a key factor in neonatal physiology and may directly influence disease progression (Disease). Adding this edge could better capture the causal mechanism by which abnormal ductal flow contributes to disease outcomes.)\n3. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypDistrib (hypoxia distribution) likely plays a role in the development of disease. Adding this edge would help model how uneven hypoxia distribution contributes to disease onset or severity.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.0811).

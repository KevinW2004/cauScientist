However, it is unclear whether this is a direct causal link or if other variables mediate this relationship. To improve the graph, we should consider the following candidate changes:\n\n1. **Add** a direct edge from Disease to CardiacMixing, as Disease may independently influence CardiacMixing through mechanisms unrelated to HypoxiaInO2.\n2. **Delete** the edge from HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2, as CO2 may be more directly influenced by LungParench, and the contribution of HypoxiaInO2 may be indirect.\n3. **Add** a direct edge from Disease to LungParench, as Disease may directly affect lung parenchyma independently of HypoxiaInO2.\n\nTo verify these changes, we design targeted experiments for each candidate operation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: Disease may directly affect cardiac mixing through structural or functional heart changes, independent of HypoxiaInO2. This would align with clinical observations of congenital heart defects and disease progression.)\n2. DELETE: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2 (Reasoning: The current graph suggests that CO2 is influenced by both HypoxiaInO2 and LungParench. However, if LungParench is a more direct cause of CO2, then the HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2 edge may be spurious or mediated.)\n3. ADD: Disease \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Disease can directly impact lung parenchyma, such as through inflammation or structural damage, independent of HypoxiaInO2. This is supported by clinical evidence of lung disease progression in neonates with underlying conditions.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.0811).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

This suggests that HypDistrib could be an intermediate variable, and the current edge may be spurious or mediated by other factors like LungParench and Age. To refine the graph, we should test whether CardiacMixing directly affects HypoxiaInO2 or if it is mediated through HypDistrib. Additionally, there are several variables (e.g., HypDistrib, LungParench, LowerBodyO2, RUQO2) that may be related to HypoxiaInO2 but are not currently connected. We should also consider whether Disease has a direct effect on LVH, as it is currently only connected to DuctFlow and CardiacMixing. Lastly, we should explore whether Grunting has a direct effect on Disease, as GruntingReport is currently only a report of Grunting.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The tentative notes suggest that the relationship between CardiacMixing and HypoxiaInO2 may be indirect, possibly mediated by HypDistrib. Removing this edge would allow us to test whether HypDistrib is a more direct causal link.)\n2. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Given that HypDistrib is a potential mediator between CardiacMixing and HypoxiaInO2, adding this edge would allow us to better model the causal pathway and test for mediation.)\n3. ADD: Disease \u2192 LVH (Reasoning: Disease is currently only connected to DuctFlow and CardiacMixing. However, LVH is a cardiac condition that could plausibly be a direct result of Disease, and adding this edge would help clarify the causal relationships in the cardiac pathway.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LungParench', 'Age'], do(CardiacMixing) affects HypDistrib (avg_TVD=0.0545).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

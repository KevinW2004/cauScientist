This confirms that CardiacMixing is an ancestor of HypoxiaInO2, but it does not necessarily mean the relationship is direct. However, given the experimental evidence, we cannot delete this edge. Instead, we consider adding a new edge HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2, which aligns with the domain reasoning that HypDistrib (oxygen distribution) could be a mediator or direct cause of HypoxiaInO2. Experimental evidence supports the existence of a direct link between HypDistrib and HypoxiaInO2, as seen in [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['CardiacMixing', 'LungParench'], do(HypDistrib) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.1374).

This edge may not be a direct causal link but could instead be mediated by other variables like HypDistrib or LungParench. Additionally, the presence of variables like HypoxiaInO2, LowerBodyO2, and RUQO2 suggests a potential causal pathway involving oxygen distribution, which could be missing in the graph. Lastly, the variable Disease has a direct influence on DuctFlow and CardiacMixing, but it may also influence HypoxiaInO2 indirectly through CardiacMixing.

ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: HypDistrib is a measure of oxygen distribution and may directly influence HypoxiaInO2. Adding this edge would better capture the causal mechanism of how oxygen distribution leads to hypoxia, which is a critical aspect of disease progression in this domain.)\n3.

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

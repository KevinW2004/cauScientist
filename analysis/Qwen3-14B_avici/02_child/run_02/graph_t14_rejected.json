While adding Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 directly has previously failed, the presence of Disease \u2192 LungParench and the plausible mechanism of LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 suggests that strengthening the connection between LungParench and HypoxiaInO2 may better capture the causal pathway. Since the current graph already includes Disease \u2192 LungParench, we should test whether adding LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 improves the model fit and better reflects the biological mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - Disease -> DuctFlow\n  - Disease -> CardiacMixing\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n  - Disease -> LungParench\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 10):\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -139551.20775859297\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -141720.0571, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'CardiacMixing', 'HypoxiaInO2')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -140529.7739, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Disease', 'HypoxiaInO2')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -139570.0559, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LungParench', 'LowerBodyO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

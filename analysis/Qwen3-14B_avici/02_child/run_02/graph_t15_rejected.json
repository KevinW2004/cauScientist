These relationships are suspected to be mediated or non-causal. To refine the graph, we consider deleting these edges if no direct causal effect is observed. Additionally, we consider adding plausible direct relationships based on domain knowledge and the structure of the current graph. For example, BirthAsphyxia may directly affect LungParenchyma (LungParench), which in turn influences HypoxiaInO2. This would help clarify the mediation pathway.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: BirthAsphyxia \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that BirthAsphyxia \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 is likely mediated by other variables. If this is true, removing the direct edge would improve the graph.)\n2. DELETE: LVHreport \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that LVHreport \u2192 Disease is not a direct effect and is likely mediated by other variables. Removing this edge would better align the graph with the observed data.)\n3. DELETE: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing is not a direct effect and may be mediated by other variables. Removing this edge would help clarify the true causal structure.)\n4. ADD: BirthAsphyxia \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, BirthAsphyxia can directly impact lung parenchymal function, which is a known mediator of HypoxiaInO2. Adding this edge would better explain the indirect pathway from BirthAsphyxia to HypoxiaInO2.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Disease', 'Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.0877).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

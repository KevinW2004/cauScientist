HISTORY is a static or historical factor, while LVFAILURE is a dynamic physiological state. It is more plausible that HISTORY could influence LVFAILURE (e.g., prior cardiac conditions leading to failure), but this edge has been repeatedly rejected by the system. Instead of attempting to reverse or delete this edge, we focus on adding edges that are more directly supported by domain knowledge and causal mechanisms. A promising candidate is adding a direct causal relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and STROKEVOLUME, as hypovolemia can reduce stroke volume through decreased preload. However, this edge has previously failed, suggesting potential constraints on the model. We will instead explore another plausible edge: adding a direct causal relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVEDVOLUME, as hypovolemia reduces left ventricular end-diastolic volume through decreased preload, which is a well-supported causal mechanism in cardiovascular physiology.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 17):\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -127378.8808770171\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

Hypovolemia (low blood volume) can lead to reduced preload, which in turn can cause left ventricular failure. However, previous attempts to add this edge have failed, possibly due to constraints in the model or other confounding variables. Instead of adding HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE directly, I propose exploring the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVEDVOLUME, as hypovolemia is known to reduce left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which is a direct precursor to LVFAILURE. This modification aligns with domain knowledge and may improve the model's structure without violating existing constraints.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -128332.1320505405\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -128338.1220, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -128757.7647, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LVFAILURE', 'LVEDVOLUME')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME or LVEDVOLUME \u2192 LVFAILURE not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 19: REVERSE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME or LVEDVOLUME \u2192 LVFAILURE not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

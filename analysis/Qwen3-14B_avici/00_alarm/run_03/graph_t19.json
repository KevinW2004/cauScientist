However, the edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY was previously flagged as a candidate for deletion due to potential confounding by static covariates. Given the strong interventional evidence supporting this edge, we must retain it. Additionally, the candidate operation to delete LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY is explicitly excluded due to prior failure. Therefore, we focus on the proposed additions: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP and TPR \u2192 CO. The evidence for HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP is not directly supported by interventional data, and the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on CVP may be mediated by other variables such as LVEDVOLUME or STROKEVOLUME. For TPR \u2192 CO, the marginal evidence is not significant (TVD=0.0783), and the effect of TPR on CO may be mediated through BP. Thus, we do not add these edges at this time.

This suggests that the relationship may not be a direct causal influence but rather a correlation due to unmeasured or static factors. To improve the graph, we consider removing this edge. Additionally, we suspect that HYPOVOLEMIA may have a direct influence on CVP and PCWP, which are indicators of preload, and that TPR may influence CO through vascular resistance. These relationships may be missing or underrepresented in the current graph and could be added to better represent the physiological pathways.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CO -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: The edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY is flagged as potentially confounded or anomalous. This relationship may not represent a direct causal influence but rather a correlation due to static covariates. Removing this edge could improve the graph's accuracy.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is a condition of reduced blood volume, which directly affects preload and should influence central venous pressure (CVP). This relationship is physiologically plausible and may be missing from the current graph.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is a key determinant of cardiac output (CO) via the relationship CO = (MAP - CVP) / TPR. The current graph shows CO \u2192 BP and TPR \u2192 BP, but the direct effect of TPR on CO may be missing and should be added to capture this physiological mechanism.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

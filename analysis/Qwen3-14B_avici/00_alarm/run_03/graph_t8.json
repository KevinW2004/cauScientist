However, the relationships between HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP and HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP are not supported by the data, suggesting they may be indirect or non-existent. This implies that the current graph may have unnecessary edges from HYPOVOLEMIA to CVP and PCWP, which should be deleted. Additionally, since HYPOVOLEMIA directly affects LVEDVOLUME, and LVEDVOLUME in turn affects CVP and PCWP, the existing paths from HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP and HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP may already explain the observed relationships. Therefore, the direct edges from HYPOVOLEMIA to CVP and PCWP are likely spurious and should be removed. We also consider whether HYPOVOLEMIA has a direct effect on STROKEVOLUME, which is currently not represented in the graph, but could be plausible given its impact on LVEDVOLUME and LVFAILURE.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: Marginal and conditional tests show no significant effects of HYPOVOLEMIA on CVP, suggesting the relationship is either indirect or non-existent. Since LVEDVOLUME is a known mediator between HYPOVOLEMIA and CVP, the direct edge may be spurious.)\n2. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP (Reasoning: Marginal and conditional tests show no significant effects of HYPOVOLEMIA on PCWP, suggesting the relationship is either indirect or non-existent. Since LVEDVOLUME is a known mediator between HYPOVOLEMIA and PCWP, the direct edge may be spurious.)\n3. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA affects LVEDVOLUME, which is a known precursor to STROKEVOLUME. Given that LVFAILURE also affects STROKEVOLUME, it is plausible that HYPOVOLEMIA may have a direct or indirect influence on STROKEVOLUME, which is not currently represented in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CVP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

This suggests that either the direct causal link is weak or it is mediated by other variables. To improve the graph, we consider the following candidate changes: (1) Adding a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to LVFAILURE to test for a potential direct causal effect, (2) Adding a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to STROKEVOLUME, as hypovolemia can reduce stroke volume, and (3) Adding a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, as hypovolemia can reduce cardiac output. For each proposed addition, targeted interventional experiments are designed to verify the existence of a direct causal effect.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can directly lead to LVFAILURE by reducing preload, which can impair left ventricular function. The lack of significant effect in the previous experiment may have been due to mediation by other variables, and this direct relationship should be tested.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: Hypovolemia is known to reduce stroke volume by decreasing preload. This is a direct physiological relationship that may be missing from the current graph.)\n3. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Cardiac output (CO) is directly affected by hypovolemia through reduced stroke volume and possibly reduced heart rate. Including this direct link may improve the accuracy of the causal graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['HR', 'BP'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

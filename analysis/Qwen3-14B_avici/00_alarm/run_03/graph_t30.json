HISTORY represents a static or historical factor, while LVFAILURE is a dynamic physiological state. It is more plausible that HISTORY could influence LVFAILURE (e.g., prior cardiac conditions leading to failure). However, reversing this edge has previously failed. Instead, we focus on adding a direct causal relationship that aligns with cardiovascular physiology and has not been previously attempted. A plausible candidate is adding a direct causal relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and TPR, as hypovolemia can increase total peripheral resistance as a compensatory mechanism.

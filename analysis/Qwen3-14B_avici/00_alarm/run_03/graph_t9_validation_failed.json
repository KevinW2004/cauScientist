First, the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and STROKEVOLUME is retained due to a significant interventional effect, suggesting a direct or only partially mediated relationship. However, we suspect that LVFAILURE may also be a mediator or confounder, and we should test whether the effect is fully direct. Second, we notice that PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP is present, but we suspect that other variables like TPR or CO might also influence PAP, warranting an exploration of additional parents for PAP. Third, the current graph lacks a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to LVFAILURE, which is plausible since hypovolemia can lead to left ventricular failure, and this may be an important causal pathway. We will design targeted experiments to verify these hypotheses.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CO -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The current graph assumes LVFAILURE directly influences STROKEVOLUME. However, the tentative note suggests that HYPOVOLEMIA has a direct effect on STROKEVOLUME even after conditioning on LVFAILURE and HR. This implies that LVFAILURE may not be a direct cause of STROKEVOLUME, or its influence is fully mediated. We should test if removing this edge improves the model.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can lead to reduced preload and potentially trigger left ventricular failure. This is a plausible causal pathway that is not currently represented in the graph. Adding this edge would better capture the causal chain from hypovolemia to cardiac failure.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 PAP (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) can influence pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) by altering systemic vascular resistance and indirectly affecting pulmonary circulation. Adding this edge would account for a potential unmodeled causal influence on PAP.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, CO\u2192BP; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY; REVERSE: LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY, LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

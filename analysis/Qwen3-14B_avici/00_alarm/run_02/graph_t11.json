First, the edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY is supported by interventional evidence, so it is well-established. However, there are potential missing or incorrect edges that could be validated through targeted experiments. Specifically, the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE may be missing, as HYPOVOLEMIA is a known precursor to LVFAILURE in clinical settings. Additionally, the influence of TPR on BP may be indirect, and the relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and HRBP could be overestimated. These three candidate changes are proposed for refinement.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA (hypovolemia) is a known cause of LVFAILURE (left ventricular failure) due to reduced preload. This relationship is likely missing in the current graph and should be added to better represent the causal pathway.)\n2. DELETE: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: While TPR (total peripheral resistance) influences BP (blood pressure), this relationship may be mediated through other variables such as CO (cardiac output). Directly connecting TPR \u2192 BP without accounting for CO could be misleading, so this edge may be deleted.)\n3. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT (error low output) may not directly cause HRBP (heart rate blood pressure), as HRBP is more likely influenced by HR (heart rate) and BP (blood pressure) directly. The current edge may be spurious and should be tested.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'CO'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: MINVOLSET\u2192VENTALV, LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

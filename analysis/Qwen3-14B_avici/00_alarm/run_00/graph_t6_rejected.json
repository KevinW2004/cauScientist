Since the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on STROKEVOLUME is significant when not conditioning on LVEDVOLUME, but not significant when conditioning on LVEDVOLUME, this implies that the relationship is likely indirect and mediated by LVEDVOLUME. Therefore, the direct edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME should be deleted. Additionally, the evidence supports the addition of the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR, as the interventional effect is significant and no intermediate variables have been shown to fully mediate this relationship. However, only one operation is allowed, and the deletion of HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME is the most critical based on the marginal evidence and domain knowledge.",

Based on domain knowledge, hypovolemia can influence stroke volume through mechanisms like reduced preload, but this relationship may be mediated by other variables such as LVEDVOLUME. Therefore, it is important to verify whether this edge is direct or indirect. Additionally, there are potential missing causal relationships that could improve the graph's accuracy, such as the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on TPR or the effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS. Finally, the relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and HRBP may be confounded by other variables like HR, and should be tested for directness.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME may be indirect, as hypovolemia likely affects stroke volume through LVEDVOLUME. This edge could be a spurious or mediated relationship and should be tested for directness.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can lead to compensatory vasoconstriction, increasing total peripheral resistance (TPR). This relationship is plausible and may be missing in the current graph.)\n3. ADD: DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS (Reasoning: A disconnected tube could lead to a drop in pressure (PRESS), especially in ventilated patients. This causal relationship is plausible but not currently represented in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

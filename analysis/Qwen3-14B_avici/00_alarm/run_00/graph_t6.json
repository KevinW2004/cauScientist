Here are three candidate operations that require further investigation:\n\n1. **Add an edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to LVFAILURE**: Hypovolemia (low blood volume) is a known cause of left ventricular failure, as it reduces preload and can lead to inadequate cardiac output. This relationship is not currently present in the graph and is critical for modeling the progression of circulatory failure.\n\n2. **Delete the edge from LVFAILURE to HISTORY**: History is typically a static variable that may not be directly influenced by LVFAILURE. It is more likely that HISTORY influences LVFAILURE (e.g., prior heart disease), not the other way around. The current edge seems to be reversed and should be investigated.\n\n3. **Reverse the edge from BP to TPR**: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is a major determinant of blood pressure (BP), not the other way around. The current edge suggests BP influences TPR, which is unlikely. Reversing this edge would align with physiological principles.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: Hypovolemia reduces preload and can lead to left ventricular failure. This is a well-established physiological relationship that is not currently represented in the graph.)\n2. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: HISTORY is a static variable that likely influences LVFAILURE rather than being influenced by it. The current edge seems to be reversed and should be removed.)\n3. REVERSE: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is a major determinant of blood pressure (BP), not the other way around. The current edge suggests BP influences TPR, which is not consistent with physiological knowledge.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, CATECHOL\u2192HR; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY; REVERSE: VENTLUNG\u2192MINVOL\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Based on the tentative note, the edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY is flagged as potentially ancestral, suggesting that the relationship may be mediated by intermediate variables such as LVEDVOLUME or STROKEVOLUME. This raises the possibility that LVFAILURE does not directly influence HISTORY, but rather through other variables. Additionally, we observe that HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE both influence STROKEVOLUME, which in turn influences CO. This suggests that other variables like LVEDVOLUME or TPR may also have indirect effects. Lastly, the influence of INTUBATION on SHUNT and VENTALV appears to be complex and could benefit from further experimental validation.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  - STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: The edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY is flagged as potentially ancestral. If this relationship is indirect, removing it may improve the graph by reducing spurious or unverified direct connections.)\n2. ADD: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: Since LVEDVOLUME is a downstream effect of LVFAILURE and may mediate its influence on HISTORY, adding this edge could better represent the true causal pathway.)\n3. REVERSE: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: The current graph has BP \u2192 TPR, but in reality, TPR can influence BP through vascular resistance. Reversing this edge may better reflect the physiological relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

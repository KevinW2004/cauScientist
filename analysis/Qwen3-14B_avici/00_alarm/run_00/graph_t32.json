This supports the deletion of the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE, which is not present in the current graph but was previously attempted and failed. However, the experimental evidence strongly suggests this relationship is not causal and should be removed from the graph if it were present. Since the graph currently does not include this edge, we cannot perform the deletion operation directly. Therefore, we focus on other candidate operations that are valid and supported by the evidence.",

However, the tentative notes indicate that multiple experiments have shown no significant effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on LVFAILURE, suggesting that this relationship is not directly causal. Similarly, HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR is also not supported by experimental evidence. Therefore, we consider these as candidate deletions. Additionally, the graph does not currently include a direct relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and STROKEVOLUME, but this is already present in the graph, so we consider adding a potential indirect relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and TPR through other variables such as CO or BP, which may be influenced by both HYPOVOLEMIA and TPR. This is a speculative addition that requires verification.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  - MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  - VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  - VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  - VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  - PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  - VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  - VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  - HR \u2192 HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  - HR \u2192 HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  - HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  - TPR \u2192 CO\n  - TPR \u2192 BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1.

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO; DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192TPR, LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE; REVERSE: LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

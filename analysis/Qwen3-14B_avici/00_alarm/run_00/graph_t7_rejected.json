However, based on the tentative note, there is evidence suggesting that this edge may be reversed, i.e., BP \u2192 TPR. This reversal would better align with physiological understanding, where blood pressure can influence total peripheral resistance through reflex mechanisms (e.g., baroreceptor response). To verify this, we should test whether manipulating BP affects TPR. Additionally, there may be missing causal links between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE, as hypovolemia can lead to reduced preload and subsequently LVFAILURE. Another candidate is the relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and STROKEVOLUME, as low output could be a consequence of reduced stroke volume. These three candidates will be tested with targeted experiments.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Based on tentative notes and physiological understanding, BP may influence TPR through reflex mechanisms, suggesting the edge should be reversed from TPR \u2192 BP to BP \u2192 TPR.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can reduce preload, leading to decreased cardiac output and potentially LVFAILURE. This causal link is physiologically plausible and may be missing in the current graph.)\n3. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: Low stroke volume can result in low cardiac output, which may trigger an error signal such as ERRLOWOUTPUT. This direct causal influence is likely but not currently represented in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

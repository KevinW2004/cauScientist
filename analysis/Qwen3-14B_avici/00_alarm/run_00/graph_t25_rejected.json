Similarly, the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR has been shown to have no significant effect when conditioned on other variables, suggesting it is not a direct causal link. However, the current graph lacks a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, which is supported by the evidence that do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CO (TVD=0.1450). This suggests an ancestral path that should be validated. Since HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO are already in the graph, adding a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO is a valid refinement to reflect the known causal pathway.",

Both are flagged as lacking sufficient evidence for their existence. Additionally, we notice that HYPOVOLEMIA is a known cause of reduced stroke volume and can influence cardiac output through its effect on stroke volume. However, the current graph does not include a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, which could be a missing causal pathway. We propose three candidate operations: (1) deleting HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE, (2) deleting HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR, and (3) adding HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO. Each of these changes is supported by the tentative notes and domain knowledge about hemodynamics.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  - MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  - VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  - VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  - VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  - PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  - VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  - VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  - HR \u2192 HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  - HR \u2192 HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  - HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  - TPR \u2192 CO\n  - TPR \u2192 BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: The tentative notes indicate insufficient evidence for this relationship. Multiple experiments have shown no significant effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on LVFAILURE, suggesting that this edge is not supported by empirical data.)\n2. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: The tentative notes also indicate that HYPOVOLEMIA has no significant effect on TPR. This suggests that the current edge may be an artifact of the model and should be removed to improve accuracy.)\n3. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is known to reduce stroke volume, and stroke volume directly influences cardiac output (CO). Since the graph currently lacks a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, adding this edge would better reflect the known causal pathway from hypovolemia to reduced cardiac output.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192TPR\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

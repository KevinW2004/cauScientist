Domain knowledge in the alarm domain suggests that HISTORY (likely referring to patient medical history) is more likely to influence LVFAILURE (left ventricular failure) rather than the other way around. Therefore, reversing this edge may better align with causal intuition. Additionally, there may be missing causal relationships that could improve the graph. For example, HYPOVOLEMIA (hypovolemia) is a critical factor in cardiovascular function and is likely to influence LVFAILURE and STROKEVOLUME. Furthermore, ERRLOWOUTPUT (error low output) is a diagnostic alarm that may be influenced by multiple variables, including CO (cardiac output), which is directly influenced by STROKEVOLUME and HR (heart rate). These relationships are not explicitly represented in the current graph and may be important for accuracy.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: HISTORY \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: The edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY is flagged as potentially spurious or reversed. Domain knowledge suggests that medical history (HISTORY) is more likely to influence the likelihood of LVFAILURE rather than the other way around.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: Hypovolemia is a known cause of reduced preload and can lead to left ventricular failure. Adding this edge would better reflect the physiological causal relationship between hypovolemia and LVFAILURE.)\n3. ADD: CO \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT is a diagnostic alarm that is likely triggered based on low cardiac output. Since CO is directly influenced by STROKEVOLUME and HR, it is reasonable to expect that CO influences ERRLOWOUTPUT.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (TVD=0.0385). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['TPR', 'HR']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects BP (TVD=0.1923). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(LVFAILURE) affects HISTORY (TVD=0.3291). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HISTORY) affects LVFAILURE (TVD=0.1154). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LVEDVOLUME'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0000). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HR', 'STROKEVOLUME'], do(CO) affects ERRLOWOUTPUT (avg_TVD=0.0252).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

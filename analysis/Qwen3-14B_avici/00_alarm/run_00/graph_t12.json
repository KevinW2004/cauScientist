This suggests that the direct influence of LVFAILURE on HISTORY may not exist, and instead, the effect is indirect. Therefore, the edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY could be deleted. Additionally, the graph lacks direct connections from HYPOVOLEMIA to CVP or PCWP, which are both influenced by LVEDVOLUME. Since HYPOVOLEMIA also affects STROKEVOLUME, it is plausible that HYPOVOLEMIA could directly influence LVEDVOLUME, which in turn affects CVP and PCWP. Lastly, the graph does not include a direct influence of ERRLOWOUTPUT on STROKEVOLUME, which may be necessary to explain how low output errors could affect cardiac function. These three relationships\u2014deletion of LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY, addition of HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME, and addition of ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\u2014are proposed as candidate changes to refine the causal graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: The edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY may be mediated by intermediate variables like LVEDVOLUME or STROKEVOLUME. If the effect of LVFAILURE on HISTORY is indirect, this edge should be removed.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is known to reduce preload, which affects LVEDVOLUME. Since LVEDVOLUME in turn influences CVP and PCWP, adding this edge would provide a more direct causal pathway from HYPOVOLEMIA to these variables.)\n3. ADD: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT could directly affect cardiac output, which is influenced by STROKEVOLUME. Adding this edge would clarify the causal mechanism through which low output errors influence cardiac function.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Based on domain knowledge and standard physiological and mechanical relationships in intensive care monitoring systems, three candidate changes are proposed:\n\n1. **Add**: CO \u2192 BP. While the graph currently includes TPR \u2192 BP and CO \u2192 BP, the direct causal effect of CO on BP is well-established in cardiovascular physiology. CO is a major determinant of BP, and the current graph may not explicitly represent this link.\n\n2. **Delete**: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY. 'HISTORY' is likely a static variable or a record of past events, not a dynamic outcome of LVFAILURE. It is unlikely that LVFAILURE directly influences the 'HISTORY' variable, which may be a confounder or a covariate rather than a direct effect.\n\n3. **Reverse**: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP. In cardiovascular physiology, CVP (central venous pressure) is a measure of right atrial pressure and is influenced by LVEDVOLUME (left ventricular end-diastolic volume) indirectly. However, LVEDVOLUME is not a direct cause of CVP. Instead, CVP may influence LVEDVOLUME via preload and venous return, suggesting that the direction of the edge may be reversed.\n\nFor each of these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to test the existence or directionality of the causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Cardiac output (CO) is a primary determinant of blood pressure (BP) via the Frank-Starling mechanism and systemic vascular resistance. Adding this direct edge aligns with physiological principles and may better capture the causal influence of CO on BP.)\n2. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: HISTORY is likely a static or recorded variable, not a dynamic effect of LVFAILURE. Removing this edge avoids spurious causality and aligns with the nature of the variable.)\n3. REVERSE: CVP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: CVP (central venous pressure) is a reflection of preload and venous return, which can influence LVEDVOLUME. The reverse direction aligns with the physiological mechanism of venous return affecting left ventricular filling.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0024). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['VENTMACH', 'VENTTUBE'], do(KINKEDTUBE) affects DISCONNECT (avg_TVD=0.0588). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['CO', 'BP'], do(ERRLOWOUTPUT) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.1786). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HR', 'LVFAILURE'], do(TPR) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.1548). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'CO']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(LVFAILURE) affects HISTORY (TVD=0.4463). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(ERRLOWOUTPUT) affects BP (avg_TVD=0.0000). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR'], do(CO) affects BP (avg_TVD=0.2060).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nREVERSE: BP\u2192ERRLOWOUTPUT\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

This suggests that either the relationship is spurious or there is a missing intermediate variable that connects LVFAILURE to HISTORY. To improve the graph, we propose three candidate operations: (1) deleting the spurious edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY, (2) adding a plausible edge from ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HISTORY, and (3) adding an edge from HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT, as hypoventilation and hypovolemia are both known to contribute to low cardiac output and may influence the error signal. For each of these, we design targeted experiments to verify the causal influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: HISTORY is a static variable and cannot be causally influenced by LVFAILURE, a dynamic physiological state. This edge is likely spurious and should be removed.)\n2. ADD: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT is a dynamic signal that may be recorded as part of a patient's medical history. It is plausible that low output events contribute to the formation of a medical history record, making this a reasonable addition.)\n3. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: Hypovolemia is a known cause of low cardiac output and may directly contribute to the generation of the ERRLOWOUTPUT signal. This relationship aligns with clinical knowledge and could improve the graph's accuracy.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0024).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

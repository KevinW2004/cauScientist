    "reasoning": "Based on the interventional evidence, the edge LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY is supported by a significant effect (TVD=0.4463), indicating that LVFAILURE is an ancestor of HISTORY. However, the experimental evidence also suggests that this relationship may be mediated by intermediate variables (e.g., LVEDVOLUME, CO, STROKEVOLUME). Given the strict policy to only delete edges with no significant effect, and since this edge shows a significant effect, we cannot delete it. Instead, we must consider whether there is a more direct or unmediated path from LVFAILURE to HISTORY. However, no such evidence exists to suggest a reversal. Therefore, we maintain the current edge and focus on other candidate operations.",

HISTORY is likely a confounder or a downstream variable influenced by other factors, not a direct consequence of LVFAILURE. Additionally, based on the tentative note, the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE is suspected to be indirect or spurious. Lastly, the graph lacks a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to LVFAILURE, which may be a plausible causal pathway. These three changes\u2014deleting LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY, deleting HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME, and adding HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE\u2014are proposed to refine the graph. Experiments are designed to validate or reject these changes.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: HISTORY is unlikely to be a direct effect of LVFAILURE. It may instead be a confounder or a downstream variable influenced by other factors. Removing this edge would better align the graph with causal intuition.)\n2. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on STROKEVOLUME may be mediated through other variables (e.g., LVFAILURE) or is spurious. Removing this direct edge could help isolate the true causal pathways.)\n3. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA may directly cause LVFAILURE. This is a plausible causal pathway in the alarm domain, and the tentative note highlights the need to investigate this potential direct effect.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, the experimental evidence also suggests that this relationship may be mediated by intermediate variables (e.g., LVEDVOLUME, CO, STROKEVOLUME). Given the strict policy to only delete edges with no significant effect, and since this edge shows a significant effect, we cannot delete it.

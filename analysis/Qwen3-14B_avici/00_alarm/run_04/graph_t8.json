Based on the alarm domain and physiological understanding, three candidate changes are proposed to refine the causal graph:\n\n1. **Add a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO**: Hypovolemia (low blood volume) is a known cause of reduced cardiac output (CO), which is a central physiological consequence. While HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO is present, a direct link from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO may better capture the immediate causal influence on cardiac output.\n\n2. **Delete the edge from LVFAILURE to HISTORY**: HISTORY is a variable that likely represents a record of past events or patient history. It is unlikely that LVFAILURE (a current condition) directly causes a change in HISTORY. This edge may be an artifact of modeling or misinterpretation of temporal data.\n\n3. **Reverse the edge from CO to ERRLOWOUTPUT**: While CO is a determinant of low output, ERRLOWOUTPUT is an error or alarm flag that may be triggered by low CO. However, in the current graph, CO \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT implies that CO causes the error. It is more plausible that low CO is a consequence of the error flag being raised, or that the error flag is a symptom of low CO. Reversing this edge would better align with the direction of influence in alarm systems, where alarms are triggered by abnormal physiological states, not the other way around.\n\nFor each of these candidate changes, targeted interventional experiments are designed to validate the proposed causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Hypovolemia directly reduces preload, leading to decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. Including this direct relationship captures the immediate physiological impact of hypovolemia on cardiac output.)\n2. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY (Reasoning: HISTORY is likely a static variable representing past medical events, not a dynamic outcome of LVFAILURE. This edge is not supported by domain knowledge and may be a modeling artifact.)\n3. REVERSE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT is more likely an indicator or alarm triggered by low CO, not a cause of it. Reversing this edge aligns with the causal direction in alarm systems, where alarms are generated based on physiological measurements.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0024).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, BP\u2192TPR; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY; REVERSE: BP\u2192ERRLOWOUTPUT, LVEDVOLUME\u2192CVP, ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192HRBP, LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

This suggests that the causal influence from LVFAILURE to ERRLOWOUTPUT may be indirect and mediated by other variables, such as STROKEVOLUME or CO, which are known to influence ERRLOWOUTPUT. Therefore, the direct edge LVFAILURE \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT may be unnecessary or incorrect. Additionally, based on domain knowledge, there may be missing causal relationships, such as between HYPOVOLEMIA and CO, and between TPR and CO. These could be important for accurately modeling the causal structure of the system. Finally, the relationship between KINKEDTUBE and PRESS is currently included, but it may be reversed or conditional on other variables like VENTMACH or VENTTUBE.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> HISTORY\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: The direct causal influence from LVFAILURE to ERRLOWOUTPUT is questionable. It may be mediated by intermediate variables such as STROKEVOLUME and CO, which are known to influence ERRLOWOUTPUT. Removing this edge would help clarify whether the relationship is direct or indirect.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is a known cause of reduced cardiac output (CO), and CO is a key determinant of ERRLOWOUTPUT. Including a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO would better align the graph with clinical and physiological knowledge.)\n3. REVERSE: PRESS \u2192 KINKEDTUBE (Reasoning: The current edge KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS may be reversed. A kinked tube could be a consequence of pressure changes in the system, or the relationship may be conditional on other variables like VENTMACH or VENTTUBE. Reversing the direction would allow for better modeling of the causal influence.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0024).

Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

This would better reflect the mediating role of LVEDVOLUME in the causal pathway. Additionally, I suspect that there may be a direct causal influence from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, as HYPOVOLEMIA can reduce stroke volume, which in turn affects cardiac output (CO). Finally, I suspect that TPR might also influence HRBP directly, not only through BP, as changes in total peripheral resistance can directly affect blood pressure and heart rate response.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: The current graph includes a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to LVFAILURE, but this is likely mediated by LVEDVOLUME. Removing this direct edge would align the graph with the tentative note and improve the accuracy of the causal representation.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA can reduce stroke volume, which directly influences CO. Therefore, a direct causal relationship from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO is plausible and should be considered for inclusion in the graph.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance) directly influences blood pressure (BP), and BP in turn influences HRBP (Heart Rate Blood Pressure). However, TPR can also directly affect HRBP through reflex mechanisms. Adding this direct edge would better capture the full causal influence of TPR on HRBP.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['TPR', 'HR', 'CO'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

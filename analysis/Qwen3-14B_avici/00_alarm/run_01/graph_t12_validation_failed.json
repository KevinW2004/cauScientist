Since previous attempts to add HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE failed, we should explore other plausible edges involving HYPOVOLEMIA. Based on domain knowledge, HYPOVOLEMIA can directly influence LVFAILURE, but if that edge is not valid, it may be due to confounding variables or missing intermediate steps. Alternatively, HYPOVOLEMIA could influence LVEDVOLUME, which is already connected to LVFAILURE.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVFAILURE\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

Based on the variables and existing structure, the following candidate changes are proposed:\n\n1. **Add HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE**: Hypovolemia (low blood volume) is a known cause of left ventricular failure, as it reduces preload and can lead to inadequate cardiac output, especially in the presence of other stressors. This edge is missing in the current graph and should be added to better reflect the causal pathway from systemic fluid status to cardiac dysfunction.\n\n2. **Add HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME**: Stroke volume is directly influenced by preload, which is determined by intravascular volume. Hypovolemia reduces preload, which in turn reduces stroke volume. This relationship is not currently represented and is critical for modeling fluid dynamics in the circulatory system.\n\n3. **Delete ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP**: While ERRLOWOUTPUT (a low-output alarm) might be correlated with HRBP (heart rate blood pressure), it is unlikely to have a direct causal influence on HRBP. The current graph may be overfitting by including this edge. An experiment would help determine if this is a spurious association.\n\nFor each of these changes, targeted experiments are designed to validate or reject the proposed causal influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: Hypovolemia reduces preload, which can lead to left ventricular failure, especially in the presence of other stressors. This is a well-established causal relationship in cardiovascular physiology.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: Stroke volume is directly influenced by preload, which is determined by intravascular volume. Hypovolemia reduces preload, which in turn reduces stroke volume. This is a core principle of the Frank-Starling mechanism.)\n3. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT is likely a downstream indicator or alarm, not a direct cause of HRBP. This edge may represent a spurious or indirect relationship that should be tested.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0821). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['VENTMACH', 'VENTTUBE'], do(KINKEDTUBE) affects VENTLUNG (avg_TVD=0.3801). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['PRESS', 'VENTTUBE']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(VENTALV) affects DISCONNECT (TVD=0.0305).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

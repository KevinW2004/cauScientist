This suggests that the direct edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME may not be necessary and could be removed. Additionally, there are several variables in the graph that may be missing direct or indirect causal connections based on domain knowledge. For example, TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance) could influence CO (Cardiac Output) through its effect on afterload, and CO could influence BP (Blood Pressure) directly. Lastly, ERRLOWOUTPUT may influence HRBP (Heart Rate Blood Pressure) directly, not only through HR (Heart Rate). These three changes are prioritized for refinement.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on STROKEVOLUME is non-significant when conditioning on LVEDVOLUME, suggesting that the influence is indirect and mediated through LVEDVOLUME. Removing the direct edge may improve the graph's accuracy and reduce overfitting.)\n2. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Cardiac Output (CO) directly influences Blood Pressure (BP) through the relationship BP = CO \u00d7 TPR. While TPR \u2192 BP is present, a direct edge from CO \u2192 BP is missing and should be added to reflect the physiological mechanism.)\n3. ADD: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT may directly affect HRBP (Heart Rate Blood Pressure) through systemic responses to low cardiac output, such as compensatory mechanisms. While HR \u2192 HRBP is present, ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP is not and may be important for capturing the full causal structure.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0821).

However, my tentative notes indicate that intermediate variables, such as LVEDVOLUME, may mediate this relationship. Therefore, I suspect that the direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to STROKEVOLUME may not be valid and should be reconsidered. Additionally, I suspect that LVEDVOLUME may be influenced by HYPOVOLEMIA, and that CO (cardiac output) may be influenced by other variables like TPR or BP, which are not currently connected. Finally, I suspect that ERRLOWOUTPUT may influence HRBP directly, not just through HR, and this should be tested.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from HYPOVOLEMIA to STROKEVOLUME may be mediated by intermediate variables like LVEDVOLUME. Therefore, removing the direct edge may improve the graph accuracy.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA could reduce intravascular volume, which would lower LVEDVOLUME, a key determinant of stroke volume. Adding this edge aligns with physiological understanding of hypovolemia's effects.)\n3. ADD: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT may directly affect HRBP (heart rate blood pressure) independently of HR, as it could represent a system alert or error that influences BP control mechanisms.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0821).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME; DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

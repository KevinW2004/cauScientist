However, previous attempts to remove or reverse this edge have failed, indicating possible constraints. Instead, we focus on adding a more plausible edge based on domain knowledge. CO (cardiac output) is influenced by STROKEVOLUME, which is already present, but CO also depends on TPR (total peripheral resistance). While TPR \u2192 CO is already present, we can confirm this edge as it aligns with the physiological equation CO = (MAP - CVP) / TPR, where TPR inversely affects CO.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192HISTORY\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

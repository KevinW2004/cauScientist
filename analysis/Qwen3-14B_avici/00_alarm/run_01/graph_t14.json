This suggests that the direct causal influence of HYPOVOLEMIA on STROKEVOLUME may not be valid if LVEDVOLUME is a mediator. Additionally, there are missing relationships that could better represent the physiological and mechanical dynamics of the alarm domain. For instance, HYPOVOLEMIA may directly influence LVEDVOLUME, and TPR may influence BP, which is currently modeled in reverse. These candidate changes aim to refine the graph by adding missing direct influences, removing potentially spurious edges, and ensuring the correct directionality of known causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The tentative notes suggest that HYPOVOLEMIA's effect on STROKEVOLUME may be mediated by LVEDVOLUME. Therefore, the direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to STROKEVOLUME may be spurious and should be tested.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is a known cause of reduced intravascular volume, which directly affects left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This missing edge may explain the indirect influence of HYPOVOLEMIA on STROKEVOLUME through LVEDVOLUME.)\n3. REVERSE: BP \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is a physiological determinant of blood pressure (BP), not the other way around. The current edge from BP to TPR is likely incorrect and should be reversed to reflect the true causal direction.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0821).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Each variable has a prefix indicating the type of measurement: C_NI (Nitrate?), CKNI (possibly Kjeldahl Nitrogen?), CBODD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand?), CKND (Kjeldahl Nitrogen?), CNOD (Nitrogen Oxide?), CBODN (Biochemical Oxygen Demand?), CKNN (Kjeldahl Nitrogen?), and CNON (Nitrogen Oxide? or Nitrate?). Based on the naming convention and the temporal structure, these variables likely represent sequential measurements of water quality parameters over time. The AVICI algorithm suggests a series of direct causal relationships from earlier time points to later ones for the same parameter type, indicating that the value at time t influences the value at time t+15, t+30, and t+45. This suggests that the earlier measurement is a direct cause of the later measurement for the same parameter. However, the AVICI relationships are not all consistent (e.g., CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 and CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30), which implies that both CBODN_12_00 and CBODN_12_15 are direct causes of CBODN_12_30. This is plausible in a time series context where the current value depends on previous values. To ensure the graph is a DAG, we must avoid cycles and ensure that all relationships are unidirectional in time. We will represent each time point as a separate node and only include direct parent relationships from earlier time points to later ones for the same parameter type.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -273885.14735101844\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

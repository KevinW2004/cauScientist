However, the edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 is inconsistent with the rest of the structure, as it bypasses the intermediate time point (CBODN_12_15). In a typical time series, the value at time t+30 would depend on the value at t+15, not directly on t. This suggests that the direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 may be spurious and should be removed to better reflect the sequential nature of the data and improve the graph's consistency with domain knowledge of water quality dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -273881.3413089501\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 or CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 19: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CBODN_12_15\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_15\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_15\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_15\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_15\u2192CBODN_12_30; DELETE: CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30; REVERSE: CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

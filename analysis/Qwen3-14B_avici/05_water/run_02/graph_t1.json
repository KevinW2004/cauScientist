The prefixes suggest the following: C_NI likely refers to 'Nitrate (NO3-)' concentration, CKNI could be 'Kjeldahl Nitrogen (organic nitrogen)', CBODD may be 'Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) Dissolved', CKND could be 'Kjeldahl Nitrogen Dissolved', CNOD might be 'Nitrate + Nitrite (NO3- + NO2-)', CBODN could be 'Biochemical Oxygen Demand Nitrogenous', CKNN might be 'Kjeldahl Nitrogen in Nitrogenous form', and CNON could be 'Nitrate and Nitrite in Organic Nitrogen form'.\n\nBased on domain knowledge, water quality parameters often evolve over time due to natural processes like decomposition, microbial activity, and chemical reactions. The temporal structure (e.g., C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15) implies that earlier measurements influence later ones, which aligns with the traditional algorithm's suggestions. However, we must ensure that all relationships are direct and avoid cycles.\n\nFor example, C_NI_12_00 directly influences C_NI_12_15, which in turn influences C_NI_12_30, and so on. Similarly, other parameters like CKNI, CBODD, CNOD, CBODN, CKNN, and CNON appear to follow similar temporal causal chains. We will model these as direct parent-child relationships while maintaining a DAG structure. No feedback loops or cycles are introduced, as the data seems to represent a forward progression in time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -273885.14735101844\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

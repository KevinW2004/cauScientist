However, previous attempts to reverse the edge from CNON_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_15 have been unsuccessful, suggesting that this edge may not be valid. Instead of repeating failed operations, I propose exploring an alternative edge that aligns with the temporal sequence and domain logic: CNON_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30. This edge reflects a plausible causal influence of nitrogen oxide on chemical oxygen demand over time, and it has not been previously tested.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 14):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -273400.0063341572\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CNON_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -273810.8007, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'CNON_12_30', 'CBODN_12_15')]\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge CNON_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CNON_12_15\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_15\u2192CNON_12_30, CBODN_12_15\u2192CNON_12_30, CNON_12_15\u2192CBODN_12_30; DELETE: CNON_12_30\u2192CBODN_12_15\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

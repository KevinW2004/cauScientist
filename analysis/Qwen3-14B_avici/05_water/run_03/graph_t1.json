Based on the naming conventions, we can infer the following: C_NI likely refers to 'Concentration of Nitrate Ion', CKNI could be 'Concentration of Kjeldahl Nitrogen', CBODD and CBODN likely refer to 'Chemical Oxygen Demand' (BOD) for different forms (dissolved or non-dissolved), CNOD may be 'Concentration of Nitrogen Oxide', and CKNN could be 'Concentration of Kjeldahl Nitrogen in Non-Dissolved form', while CNON may be 'Concentration of Nitrogen Oxide in Non-Dissolved form'.\n\nThe temporal structure (e.g., C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15) suggests a sequential process where earlier time points influence later ones. These relationships are consistent with the idea of water quality parameters changing over time due to natural processes or external interventions. Based on domain knowledge, these variables are likely to be influenced by upstream conditions, chemical reactions, biological activity, and physical mixing processes.\n\nThe AVICI algorithm suggests a chain of direct causal relationships between time points. For example, C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15 implies that the concentration of nitrate ion at time 00 directly influences its concentration at time 15. This aligns with the idea that changes in water quality parameters evolve over time in a causal, non-cyclic manner.\n\nI will construct a DAG where each variable at a later time point has direct parents from the same parameter at the immediately preceding time point. This reflects the natural progression of water quality parameters over time and avoids cycles by ensuring no backward causation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -273885.14735101844\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

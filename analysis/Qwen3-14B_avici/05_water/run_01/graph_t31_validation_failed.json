However, based on domain knowledge, the decomposition of organic matter (which increases BOD) can release nitrogenous compounds over time, making it plausible that CBODD_12_45 influences CKNN_12_00. However, the timing of this influence may not be fully aligned with the current edge. A more temporally coherent and plausible edge would be CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45, as this reflects a more direct and plausible delayed biochemical process where BOD from earlier in the time window influences total nitrogen at a later time point. This edge aligns with the observed temporal progression of variables and the known dynamics of nitrogen cycling in water systems.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CBODD_12_45 -> CNOD_12_00\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 26):\n  CBODD_12_45 \u2192 CNOD_12_00\n  CBODD_12_45 \u2192 CKNN_12_00\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -254574.08520337398\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -270297.1316, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'CBODD_12_45', 'CKNN_12_00')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODD_12_45 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -270289.7796, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'CKNN_12_00', 'CBODD_12_45')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

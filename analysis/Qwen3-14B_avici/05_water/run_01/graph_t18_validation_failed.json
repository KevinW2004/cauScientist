The previous failed attempt to add CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 suggests that this edge may not be directly valid in the current structure, but it may be plausible at a later time step (e.g., 15 minutes later). Therefore, I propose testing the addition of CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 as a more temporally aligned and plausible edge, reflecting the delayed effect of BOD on nitrogen compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -273549.2927485556\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -277775.2525, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'CNOD_12_15', 'CNOD_12_30')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 or CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -274286.4362, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'CBODD_12_30', 'CNOD_12_45')]\nAttempt 7: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: ADD operation failed: edge CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

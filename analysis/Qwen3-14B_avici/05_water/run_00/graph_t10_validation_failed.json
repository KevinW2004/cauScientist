However, this may not represent true causality but rather a common cause influencing both measurements. For example, the same inflow or chemical reaction may affect C_NI at t=00 and t=15. To refine the graph, we should consider removing direct temporal edges and instead focus on plausible causal relationships based on water chemistry and dynamics. One such relationship is between CBODN and CKNN, as both are related to nitrogen compounds and may influence each other through biological or chemical processes. Adding this edge would better reflect the underlying causal mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -277152.60545731144\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -279366.8188, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'CBODN_12_00', 'CKNN_12_00')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -280242.7478, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'C_NI_12_00', 'C_NI_12_15')]\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_15, CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_00, CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_00, CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_00, CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_00, CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_00, CBODN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_00; DELETE: C_NI_12_00\u2192C_NI_12_15\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

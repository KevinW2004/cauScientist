The naming convention suggests that the first part of the variable name (e.g., C_NI, CKNI, CBODD, etc.) refers to specific water quality indicators, while the time suffix (e.g., _12_00) indicates the time of measurement. Based on this, we can infer that the data is collected over time at a fixed location, likely in a river, stream, or wastewater treatment system. The AVICI algorithm has already identified a set of time-based causal relationships, such as C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15, which suggests that the value of a parameter at one time point influences its value at the next time point. This aligns with the intuition that water quality parameters tend to evolve over time due to natural processes, flow dynamics, or external inputs. However, the AVICI relationships suggest direct temporal links, which may not always represent true causality (e.g., a measurement at t=00 may not directly cause the same parameter at t=15, but rather both are influenced by a common cause such as inflow or chemical reactions). To construct a DAG, we must ensure no cycles and that all relationships are direct and temporally ordered. We will consider the AVICI relationships as a starting point but will refine them using domain knowledge, focusing on the possibility that earlier time points influence later ones, and that certain parameters (e.g., CBODN, CKNN, etc.) may be interrelated due to chemical or biological processes. We will also ensure that the graph does not contain any cycles, as required for a DAG.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -277190.18888057506\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

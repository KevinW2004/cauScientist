However, some variables (e.g., CBODN_12_00) are directly connected to later time points (e.g., CBODN_12_30) without passing through the intermediate time point (CBODN_12_15). This may suggest a missing intermediate causal link or a direct influence that bypasses the immediate temporal step. Based on domain knowledge, water quality parameters typically evolve gradually over time, so adding a direct edge from CBODN_12_00 to CBODN_12_30 may not be plausible without an intermediate step. Therefore, I propose removing this direct edge to better align with the expected temporal dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -282380.01687170984\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: LL too low: -282703.5691, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'CKNN_12_00', 'CKNN_12_30')]\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 19: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 20: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 21: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 22: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 23: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 24: ADD operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CKNN_12_30\u2192CBODN_12_45, CBODN_12_30\u2192CKNN_12_45, CBODN_12_30\u2192CKNN_12_45, CKNN_12_30\u2192CBODN_12_45; REVERSE: CBODN_12_30\u2192CKNN_12_45, CBODN_12_30\u2192CKNN_12_45, CBODN_12_30\u2192CKNN_12_45\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

This suggests that the direct causal influence of DrivingSkill on Accident might not hold when these variables are accounted for. Therefore, it is worth investigating whether this edge should be deleted. Additionally, there may be a missing direct relationship between 'RiskAversion' and 'Accident', as RiskAversion could influence Accident through DrivingSkill and DrivQuality, but it might also have a direct effect. Lastly, 'VehicleYear' is connected to 'MedCost', but it is unclear whether 'CarValue' also has a direct influence on 'MedCost', which could be an important factor in insurance cost modeling.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident (Reasoning: The direct edge from DrivingSkill to Accident may be confounded by DrivQuality or Mileage. Removing this edge would allow for a clearer assessment of the true causal relationship between DrivingSkill and Accident.)\n2. ADD: RiskAversion \u2192 Accident (Reasoning: RiskAversion could directly influence Accident behavior, independent of DrivingSkill or DrivQuality. Adding this edge would better capture the full causal impact of risk-averse behavior on accident likelihood.)\n3. ADD: CarValue \u2192 MedCost (Reasoning: CarValue is a strong indicator of the cost of medical treatment in the event of an accident. Including a direct edge from CarValue to MedCost would better represent the causal mechanism in insurance modeling.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: DrivingSkill\u2192Accident, Mileage\u2192Antilock\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

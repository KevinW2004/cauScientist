The tentative notes highlight three key areas for review: the confirmed relationship between CarValue and ThisCarCost, the uncertain edges between DrivingSkill and Accident, and Mileage and Theft. We will prioritize these for potential changes and design experiments to validate them.\n\n1. **DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident**: The tentative note indicates no interventional evidence confirms this edge. This suggests the relationship might be spurious or mediated by other factors. We should test this edge by intervening on DrivingSkill and observing Accident, while controlling for possible confounders like DrivQuality or DrivHist.\n\n2. **Mileage \u2192 Theft**: Similarly, no interventional evidence supports this edge. It is unclear whether mileage directly influences the likelihood of theft, or if it's a proxy for other variables like vehicle age or location. We should test this edge by intervening on Mileage and observing Theft, while controlling for VehicleYear and HomeBase.\n\n3. **Add DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident**: Given the uncertainty, we should also consider the possibility that DrivingSkill directly influences Accident. If the experiment shows a significant effect, we should add this edge to the graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - ThisCarDam -> RuggedAuto\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident (Reasoning: There is no interventional evidence confirming a direct causal relationship between DrivingSkill and Accident. This edge may be spurious or mediated by other variables like DrivQuality or DrivHist. A targeted experiment is required to confirm or refute this relationship.)\n2. DELETE: Mileage \u2192 Theft (Reasoning: There is no interventional evidence confirming a direct causal relationship between Mileage and Theft. This edge may be spurious or indirectly influenced by variables like VehicleYear or HomeBase. A targeted experiment is required to confirm or refute this relationship.)\n3. ADD: DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, DrivingSkill is likely to influence the likelihood of an Accident. If the experiment confirms this, the edge should be added to the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Mileage -> Antilock: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: DrivingSkill\u2192Accident\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

Additionally, I suspect that 'Age' may have a direct influence on 'DrivQuality', as older drivers may have more experience, and 'Mileage' might influence 'DrivHist' more directly than through 'Antilock'. Lastly, I suspect that 'VehicleYear' may directly influence 'CarValue', as newer vehicles are generally more valuable. These three relationships are proposed for testing to refine the graph.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivQuality (Reasoning: The edge 'DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivQuality' is tentatively added but requires interventional testing to confirm its direct influence. If no effect is observed, it should be deleted.)\n2. ADD: Age \u2192 DrivQuality (Reasoning: Age may directly influence driving quality, as older drivers may have more experience, and this could be a confounder or alternative pathway to DrivQuality.)\n3. ADD: VehicleYear \u2192 CarValue (Reasoning: VehicleYear is likely a direct determinant of CarValue, as newer vehicles are typically more valuable. This edge may be missing in the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment VehicleYear -> RuggedAuto: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment RuggedAuto -> ThisCarDam: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment SocioEcon -> RiskAversion: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Mileage -> Antilock: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivHist: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment RuggedAuto -> CarValue: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Age -> RiskAversion: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivHist: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Mileage -> DrivHist: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment PropCost -> OtherCarCost: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivHist: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment SocioEcon -> RiskAversion: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CarValue -> ThisCarCost: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment SocioEcon -> RiskAversion: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment RiskAversion -> DrivQuality: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CarValue -> PropCost: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment SocioEcon -> RiskAversion: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment CarValue -> PropCost: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment Age -> DrivQuality: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n- Experiment VehicleYear -> CarValue: Error - Conditional intervention testing for continuous data not yet fully implemented\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 7):\n  SocioEcon \u2192 RiskAversion\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivQuality\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -249043.44141971556\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

The tentative note highlights that the relationship 'Mileage \u2192 DrivingSkill' is based on domain knowledge but requires validation. This suggests that Mileage might influence DrivingSkill, but the direction could be reversed or non-existent. Additionally, we suspect that 'Age \u2192 DrivingSkill' may be indirect, as age could influence driving skill through experience rather than directly. Another potential issue is the absence of a direct link between 'VehicleYear' and 'RuggedAuto', which seems plausible based on the idea that newer vehicles may be less rugged. These three candidate changes\u2014reversing 'Mileage \u2192 DrivingSkill', deleting 'Age \u2192 DrivingSkill', and adding 'VehicleYear \u2192 RuggedAuto'\u2014are proposed for refinement and validation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: DrivingSkill \u2192 Mileage (Reasoning: The current graph assumes that Mileage influences DrivingSkill, but this may be reversed. Driving skill could influence the amount of mileage driven (e.g., more skilled drivers may drive more frequently or safely). This requires experimental validation to confirm the correct directionality.)\n2. DELETE: Age \u2192 DrivingSkill (Reasoning: The current graph assumes a direct effect of Age on DrivingSkill, but this may be mediated by other factors like experience or training. There is no explicit path from Age to DrivingSkill that excludes these mediators, so this edge may be spurious and should be tested.)\n3. ADD: VehicleYear \u2192 RuggedAuto (Reasoning: Newer vehicles are generally less rugged compared to older models. This is a plausible causal relationship that is not currently present in the graph. Adding this edge would better reflect how vehicle age influences the ruggedness of the car.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

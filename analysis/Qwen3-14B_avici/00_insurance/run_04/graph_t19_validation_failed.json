Based on the tentative notes, the edges 'ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto' and 'DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivQuality' are flagged for further investigation. Additionally, the relationship between 'RuggedAuto' and 'ThisCarDam' may be reversed, as it's unclear whether a car's ruggedness causes damage or if damage leads to retrofitting with rugged features. Another potential candidate for addition is 'CarValue \u2192 AntiTheft', as more valuable cars may be more likely to have anti-theft features installed. These three relationships are prioritized for verification through targeted interventional experiments.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: RuggedAuto \u2192 ThisCarDam (Reasoning: The direction of the edge 'ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto' is uncertain. It is plausible that a car's ruggedness could be a response to damage, or that damage is a result of a less rugged car. Reversing this edge allows us to test for a causal influence from RuggedAuto to ThisCarDam.)\n2. DELETE: DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivQuality (Reasoning: The edge 'DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivQuality' is present in the graph but lacks interventional evidence. It is unclear whether driving skill directly influences driving quality or if the relationship is confounded by other variables. Removing this edge allows us to test for a direct causal influence.)\n3. ADD: CarValue \u2192 AntiTheft (Reasoning: Higher car value may lead to increased installation of anti-theft features as a risk mitigation strategy. Adding this edge allows us to test for a direct causal influence of car value on the presence of anti-theft features.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- Experiment DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality: Error -

You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

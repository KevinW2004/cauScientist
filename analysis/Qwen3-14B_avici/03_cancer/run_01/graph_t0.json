Pollution and smoking are well-established risk factors for lung cancer, meaning they can directly contribute to the development of cancer. Cancer, in turn, can lead to observable symptoms and diagnostic findings such as X-ray abnormalities and dyspnoea (shortness of breath). Xray and Dyspnoea are outcomes that may be caused by cancer, but they are not direct causes of it. Additionally, Pollution and Smoker are root causes that do not have direct parents in this context. There is no known direct causal relationship between Xray and Dyspnoea, nor between Pollution and Smoker, so these should not be connected. The graph must be acyclic, so no feedback loops or cycles are allowed. Based on this, the structure should have Pollution and Smoker as root nodes, Cancer as a child of both, and Xray and Dyspnoea as children of Cancer.",

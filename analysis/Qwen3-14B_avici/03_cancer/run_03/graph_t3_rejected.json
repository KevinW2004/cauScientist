'Smoker' is a well-established risk factor for lung cancer, so it is a direct cause of 'Cancer'. 'Pollution' is also a known environmental risk factor for lung cancer, so it can be a direct cause of 'Cancer' as well. Once 'Cancer' is present, it can lead to symptoms such as 'Dyspnoea' (shortness of breath) and can be detected via 'Xray'. 'Xray' and 'Dyspnoea' are outcomes of 'Cancer', not causes. 'Smoker' and 'Pollution' are root causes with no direct parents. 'Xray' and 'Dyspnoea' are effects with 'Cancer' as their direct cause. There is no direct causal relationship between 'Smoker' and 'Pollution', nor between 'Xray' and 'Dyspnoea', and no feedback loops or cycles are present in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -17839.2507, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Smoker', 'Pollution')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge Smoker \u2192 Pollution not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: Smoker\u2192Pollution, Smoker\u2192Pollution\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Based on domain knowledge, both Pollution and Smoker are well-established risk factors for Cancer. Thus, they are direct causes of Cancer. Once Cancer is present, it can lead to symptoms such as Dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and can be detected via X-ray imaging. Xray and Dyspnoea are therefore downstream effects of Cancer. There is no direct causal link between Pollution and Smoker, nor between Xray and Dyspnoea. Additionally, Xray and Dyspnoea are not direct causes of Cancer, as they are symptoms or diagnostic tools, not risk factors. The graph must be a DAG, so we avoid cycles. For example, Cancer cannot cause Smoker or Pollution, and Xray cannot cause Cancer. This leads to a structure where Pollution and Smoker are root nodes, Cancer is their child, and Xray and Dyspnoea are children of Cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -18608.3443, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Cancer', 'Xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

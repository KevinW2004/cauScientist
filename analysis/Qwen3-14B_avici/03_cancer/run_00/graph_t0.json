Based on domain knowledge, both Pollution and Smoker are well-established risk factors for Cancer. Thus, they are direct causes of Cancer. Once Cancer is present, it can lead to symptoms such as Dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and can be detected via X-ray imaging. Xray and Dyspnoea are therefore downstream effects of Cancer. There is no direct causal link between Pollution and Smoker, nor between Xray and Dyspnoea. Additionally, Xray and Dyspnoea are not direct causes of Cancer, as they are symptoms or diagnostic tools, not risk factors. The graph must be a DAG, so we avoid cycles. For example, Cancer cannot cause Smoker or Pollution, and Xray cannot cause Cancer. This leads to a structure where Pollution and Smoker are root nodes, Cancer is their child, and Xray and Dyspnoea are children of Cancer.",

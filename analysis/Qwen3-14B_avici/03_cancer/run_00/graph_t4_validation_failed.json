However, the tentative note indicates that the effect of do(Dyspnoea) on Xray is significant, which may suggest that the direction of causality is reversed \u2014 that Xray might influence Dyspnoea. This reversal would be a critical change to consider. Additionally, the current graph lacks a direct causal link between Smoker and Xray or Smoker and Dyspnoea, which may be necessary if there are indirect or direct effects. Lastly, the influence of Pollution on Dyspnoea is not represented in the current graph, which could be important if Pollution contributes to Dyspnoea independently of Cancer.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the effect of do(Dyspnoea) on Xray is significant, which may indicate that the direction of the edge should be reversed. If Xray influences Dyspnoea, then reversing the edge would better align with the observed causal influence.)\n2. ADD: Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea (Reasoning: Smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer and can directly lead to respiratory symptoms like dyspnoea. Adding this edge would account for a potential direct causal pathway from Smoker to Dyspnoea.)\n3. ADD: Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea (Reasoning: Pollution is a known environmental risk factor for respiratory conditions. If it contributes to dyspnoea independently of Cancer, then adding this edge would improve the causal representation.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Smoker'], do(Pollution) affects Cancer (avg_TVD=0.0106).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nREVERSE: Dyspnoea\u2192Xray, Dyspnoea\u2192Xray\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

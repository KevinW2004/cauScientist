However, 'DrivQuality' may also influence 'DrivHist' (driving history), which is a critical factor in determining claims and risk.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

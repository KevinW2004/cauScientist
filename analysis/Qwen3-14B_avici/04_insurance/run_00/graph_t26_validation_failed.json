However, the current graph already includes the edge 'Mileage \u2192 DrivHist', which is consistent with this reasoning. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, it is likely well-aligned with the data. Therefore, no changes are necessary for this edge. Instead, we can consider adding a new edge based on the relationship between 'DrivingSkill' and 'Accident', as better driving skills are expected to reduce the likelihood of accidents. This is a plausible and direct causal relationship that has not yet been explicitly modeled in the graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - DrivingSkill -> DrivQuality\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 11):\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivQuality\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -248981.00348067452\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -249806.3514, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Mileage', 'Antilock')]\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 Accident not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the insurance domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

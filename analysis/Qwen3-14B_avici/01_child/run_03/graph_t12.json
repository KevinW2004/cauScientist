However, it is also plausible that 'HypoxiaInO2' could influence 'LowerBodyO2' and 'RUQO2' through different pathways or with varying strengths. While the existing edge is reasonable, further validation is needed to ensure that this relationship is not over-simplified. For now, the edge remains as is, but we note it for potential refinement in future iterations.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> RUQO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 4):\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 RUQO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -139219.9617271924\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -139343.8790, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'CardiacMixing', 'LowerBodyO2')]\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: ADD operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

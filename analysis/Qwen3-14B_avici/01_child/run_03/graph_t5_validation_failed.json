However, it is also plausible that 'HypoxiaInO2' could influence 'LowerBodyO2' and 'RUQO2' through different pathways or with varying strengths. While the existing edge is reasonable, further validation is needed to ensure that this relationship is not over-simplified.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

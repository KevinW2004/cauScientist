This suggests potential conflicts with other dependencies or unmodeled confounding variables. Rather than directly adding or re-adding this edge, we should explore other local modifications that may improve the log-likelihood and indirectly support this relationship in future iterations. A promising candidate is to examine the relationship between CardiacMixing and LungFlow, as impaired cardiac mixing can directly affect pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation, which is likely to influence LungFlow. Adding this edge may help improve the model's fit and provide indirect support for the CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungFlow\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -138857.4858270909\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

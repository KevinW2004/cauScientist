The previous attempt to reverse this edge led to a lower likelihood, suggesting that the original direction is more plausible. However, we may need to explore other edges that could better capture the causal dynamics of the system. One promising candidate is the relationship between HypoxiaInO2 and LowerBodyO2, as hypoxia in oxygenation can directly impact regional oxygen levels in the lower body.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - Disease -> DuctFlow\n  - Disease -> CardiacMixing\n  - CardiacMixing -> HypoxiaInO2\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 2):\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -140214.46885164353\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -140531.8050, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HypoxiaInO2', 'LowerBodyO2')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 or LowerBodyO2 \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 or LowerBodyO2 \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

While HypoxiaInO2 is a systemic condition that can influence regional oxygenation, the relationship between systemic hypoxia and lower body oxygen saturation may be mediated by factors such as cardiac mixing and pulmonary blood flow. Given the domain context, it is plausible that CardiacMixing influences both HypoxiaInO2 and LungParench, but the previous attempt to add CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench failed. Instead, we propose adding a new edge that reflects a direct causal influence of CardiacMixing on LungFlow, which may better explain the observed variability in lung perfusion and parenchymal changes.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - Disease -> DuctFlow\n  - Disease -> CardiacMixing\n  - CardiacMixing -> HypoxiaInO2\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 8):\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungFlow\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -138454.2064504581\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -138578.1332, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'CardiacMixing', 'LowerBodyO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

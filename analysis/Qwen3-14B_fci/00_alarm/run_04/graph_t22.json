For instance, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE both influence LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, which is consistent with hemodynamic physiology. However, the relationship between STROKEVOLUME and CO is not explicitly stated, which is a critical link. Additionally, the current graph lacks a direct edge from STROKEVOLUME to CO, which is a known causal pathway. Furthermore, there is no direct influence from ERRLOWOUTPUT to CO, despite ERRLOWOUTPUT being an error signal that may indirectly affect cardiac output. Lastly, the relationship between PAP and PULMEMBOLUS is not present, but PULMEMBOLUS is known to cause elevated PAP. These three relationships\u2014STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO, ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO, and PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\u2014are strong candidates for addition or correction.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Stroke volume directly contributes to cardiac output (CO), as CO = stroke volume \u00d7 heart rate. This is a fundamental hemodynamic relationship that should be explicitly represented in the graph.)\n2. ADD: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT is an alarm indicating low cardiac output. It is likely a downstream effect of CO, but it may also influence CO through interventions or feedback mechanisms. Adding a direct edge allows for modeling of this potential causal influence.)\n3. ADD: PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP (Reasoning: Pulmonary embolism increases pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), which is a well-established physiological response. This direct causal link is missing in the current graph and should be included.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH'].

This suggests that the direct edge LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO should be deleted. Additionally, we examine whether any other indirect relationships might be overrepresented or underrepresented. For example, we suspect that 'CVP' may be influenced by 'HYPOVOLEMIA' and 'LVFAILURE' through 'LVEDVOLUME', and whether 'CO' might also be influenced directly by 'HR' or 'TPR' in addition to 'STROKEVOLUME'. We propose three candidate operations to refine the graph and design experiments to validate each.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The effect of LVEDVOLUME on CO is likely mediated by STROKEVOLUME. If STROKEVOLUME is already a mediator, the direct edge LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO is not necessary and may be an overfitting artifact.)\n2. ADD: HR \u2192 CO (Reasoning: CO (cardiac output) is influenced by both stroke volume and heart rate. Given that HR is a known determinant of CO, we suspect that HR might directly influence CO, which is currently not represented in the graph.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 CO (Reasoning: TPR (total peripheral resistance) can affect CO indirectly by influencing afterload. While TPR is currently connected to BP and CATECHOL, it may also have a direct influence on CO, particularly in the context of systemic vascular resistance.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0024).

Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

First, the direct effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO is suspected to be mediated through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, so the direct edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO should be deleted. Second, the direct effect of LVFAILURE on CO is strong, but we should confirm whether it is direct or mediated through other variables. Third, the effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS is suspected to be mediated through VENTTUBE, so the direct edge DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS should be deleted. For each of these, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to verify the causal influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The current graph includes a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, but the tentative note suggests this effect is likely mediated through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. An experiment is needed to confirm if the effect is direct or mediated.)\n2. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: LVFAILURE is currently connected to CO, but the tentative note suggests the effect is significant with strong interventional evidence. Adding the edge explicitly captures this direct influence, assuming no intermediate variables are confounding the relationship.)\n3. DELETE: DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS (Reasoning: The current graph includes a direct edge from DISCONNECT to PRESS, but the tentative note suggests this effect may be mediated through VENTTUBE. An experiment is needed to confirm if the effect is direct or mediated.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CO (TVD=0.1450). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(LVFAILURE) affects CO (TVD=0.3687). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['KINKEDTUBE', 'VENTTUBE', 'MINVOLSET']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(DISCONNECT) affects PRESS (TVD=0.1243).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192CO\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

The notes highlight three key areas where the current graph may not fully capture the direct causal relationships: (1) HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO, (2) LVFAILURE \u2192 CO, and (3) DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS. These relationships are suspected to be mediated by other variables, and we need to test for direct causality. Additionally, we consider the possibility of an unmodeled direct effect from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, which could be important for understanding systemic hemodynamic responses. For each candidate operation, we design an experiment that isolates the causal effect by intervening on the parent and observing the child, while controlling for potential confounders.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The current graph includes an indirect path from HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. The tentative note suggests that the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO is likely mediated and not direct. To confirm this, we should test if removing the direct edge does not affect the overall causal relationship.)\n2. DELETE: DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS may be mediated through VENTTUBE. To determine if this is the case, we should test whether DISCONNECT has a direct effect on PRESS, independent of VENTTUBE.)\n3. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that LVFAILURE has a significant effect on CO with strong interventional evidence. However, the current graph does not explicitly include this direct edge. Adding it would better reflect the direct causal influence of LVFAILURE on CO.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192TPR, DISCONNECT\u2192VENTLUNG; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, LVFAILURE\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, DISCONNECT\u2192PRESS, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

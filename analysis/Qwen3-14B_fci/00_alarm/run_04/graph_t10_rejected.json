However, we should also consider whether other variables like TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance) have a direct causal influence on BP (Blood Pressure). While TPR \u2192 BP is present, it is possible that BP is also influenced by CO, as increased cardiac output can elevate blood pressure. Adding an edge from CO \u2192 BP would better reflect the physiological relationship between cardiac output and systemic blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HR -> CO\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 7):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -178272.33482778494\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

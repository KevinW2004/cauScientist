However, there are potential missing or misdirected edges based on domain knowledge and physiological understanding. For instance, PULMEMBOLUS and INTUBATION both influence SHUNT, but there may be an additional influence from DISCONNECT or other ventilatory variables. Similarly, CO is influenced by both LVFAILURE and STROKEVOLUME, but CVP and PCWP are central hemodynamic variables that may also impact CO. Additionally, MINVOLSET and VENTMACH may have a direct influence on VENTTUBE, which could be missing in the current graph. These candidate changes are proposed to refine the causal structure and improve the graph\u2019s accuracy.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CVP \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Central venous pressure (CVP) is a key determinant of preload and can influence cardiac output (CO) directly, especially in the context of heart failure or volume status. This relationship is not currently represented in the graph and should be added.)\n2. ADD: PCWP \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is a measure of left atrial pressure and preload, which directly affects CO. Including this edge aligns with clinical and physiological understanding.)\n3. ADD: MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTTUBE (Reasoning: Minimum volume set (MINVOLSET) is a parameter that affects the ventilator\u2019s behavior, and in conjunction with VENTMACH, it may directly influence the state of the VENTTUBE. This relationship may be missing in the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH'].

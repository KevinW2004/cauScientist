Therefore, the edge LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO should be deleted. Additionally, the current graph lacks a direct link between STROKEVOLUME and CO, which is likely a critical mediator. Thus, an edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO should be added. Lastly, the current graph lacks a direct influence of TPR on CO, which is a well-established physiological relationship in cardiovascular dynamics. Therefore, an edge TPR \u2192 CO should be considered for addition. These changes aim to refine the graph to better reflect the underlying causal mechanisms in the alarm domain.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The effect of LVEDVOLUME on CO is not significant, suggesting that the relationship may be indirect and mediated by other variables like STROKEVOLUME. Removing the direct edge aligns with this hypothesis.)\n2. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Stroke volume is a direct determinant of cardiac output, and the current graph does not explicitly model this relationship. Adding this edge would better reflect the physiological mechanism.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is a known determinant of cardiac output. The absence of this edge may be an oversight, and adding it would improve the graph\u2019s fidelity to the underlying physiology.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'HR'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0024).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: STROKEVOLUME\u2192CO, PAP\u2192CO, STROKEVOLUME\u2192CO, HISTORY\u2192HYPOVOLEMIA; DELETE: LVEDVOLUME\u2192CO, LVEDVOLUME\u2192CO, LVEDVOLUME\u2192CO, LVEDVOLUME\u2192HRBP, LVEDVOLUME\u2192CO, LVEDVOLUME\u2192CO, LVEDVOLUME\u2192CO\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

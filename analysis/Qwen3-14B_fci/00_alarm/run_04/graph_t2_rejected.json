First, the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and CO is currently not directly represented in the graph, but the notes suggest that it may be mediated through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. Second, the direct edge from LVFAILURE to CO is present, but the notes indicate that intermediate variables should be checked to confirm whether the effect is direct or mediated. Third, the effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS is currently not directly modeled, and the notes suggest that it may be mediated through VENTTUBE. These three relationships are prioritized for verification and potential adjustment to improve the causal graph.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that HYPOVOLEMIA may have a direct effect on CO, even though it is likely mediated through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. Adding this direct edge will allow us to test whether the effect is direct or fully mediated.)\n2. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the effect of LVFAILURE on CO is significant with strong interventional evidence, but intermediate variables (e.g., STROKEVOLUME) should be checked. If the effect of LVFAILURE on CO is fully mediated, the direct edge should be removed.)\n3. DELETE: DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS may be mediated through VENTTUBE. If the effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS is not direct, the edge should be removed.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CO (TVD=0.1450). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(LVFAILURE) affects CO (TVD=0.3687). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['KINKEDTUBE', 'VENTTUBE', 'MINVOLSET']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(DISCONNECT) affects PRESS (TVD=0.1243). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'STROKEVOLUME']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CO (TVD=0.1450). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['STROKEVOLUME'], do(LVFAILURE) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.0794). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['VENTTUBE'], do(DISCONNECT) affects PRESS (avg_TVD=0.1246).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

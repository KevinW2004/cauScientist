First, the direct effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO is suspected to be mediated through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, so the direct edge may be spurious. Second, the direct effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS is suspected to be mediated through VENTTUBE, so the direct edge may also be spurious. Finally, a potential missing edge from LVFAILURE to HRBP may exist, as LVFAILURE already influences CO and CO could influence HRBP indirectly, but a direct effect might be plausible. Each of these relationships requires targeted experiments to verify their direct causal influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO is likely mediated through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, as per the tentative notes. A direct edge may not exist, and its removal would improve the graph by reducing unnecessary complexity.)\n2. DELETE: DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS (Reasoning: The effect of DISCONNECT on PRESS may be mediated through VENTTUBE, as per the tentative notes. A direct edge may not exist, and its removal would improve the graph by reducing unnecessary complexity.)\n3. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: LVFAILURE influences CO, and CO is known to influence HRBP. While there is no current edge between LVFAILURE and HRBP, a direct effect is plausible and could be confirmed with targeted experimentation.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192TPR, DISCONNECT\u2192VENTLUNG, LVFAILURE\u2192CO; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, LVFAILURE\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, DISCONNECT\u2192PRESS, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO, LVFAILURE\u2192CO\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Based on domain knowledge and the structure of the graph, I propose the following candidate changes to refine the model:\n\n1. **Add**: CVP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME. CVP (central venous pressure) is a key determinant of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and its influence may be missing in the current model. This addition aligns with hemodynamic principles where venous return influences preload.\n\n2. **Add**: PCWP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is a proxy for left atrial pressure and thus influences left ventricular filling. This relationship is likely missing and should be incorporated.\n\n3. **Delete**: TPR \u2192 CATECHOL. While total peripheral resistance (TPR) can influence blood pressure, its direct influence on catecholamine levels is weak. Catecholamine secretion is more likely a response to hypotension or other stressors, not a direct effect of TPR.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed for each candidate operation.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CVP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: CVP is a direct measure of venous return to the right heart and is strongly correlated with LVEDVOLUME. Including this edge would better reflect the hemodynamic pathway from venous pressure to left ventricular filling.)\n2. ADD: PCWP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: PCWP is a clinical estimate of left atrial pressure and thus directly influences left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This relationship is important in diagnosing left-sided heart failure and should be included.)\n3. DELETE: TPR \u2192 CATECHOL (Reasoning: TPR does not directly cause the release of catecholamines. Catecholamine release is more commonly triggered by hypotension, hypoxia, or other systemic stressors, not by TPR itself.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192BP; REVERSE: TPR\u2192BP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

First, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both known to influence LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, but there is no direct link between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE, which may be a confounder. Second, the relationship between PAP and PULMEMBOLUS is likely missing, as pulmonary embolus can directly affect pulmonary artery pressure. Third, the current graph lacks a direct link between STROKEVOLUME and CO, which is a key physiological relationship. These changes will be tested through targeted experiments.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA can lead to LVFAILURE due to reduced preload and subsequent cardiac dysfunction. This relationship is important for capturing the causal chain from hypovolemia to low cardiac output.)\n2. ADD: PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP (Reasoning: PULMEMBOLUS is a known cause of increased pulmonary artery pressure. Including this direct causal link improves the model's accuracy in reflecting physiological responses.)\n3. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Stroke volume is a primary determinant of cardiac output. Adding this direct link aligns with the physiological relationship and improves the causal structure.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR', 'VENTMACH'].

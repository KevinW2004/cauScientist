This suggests that TPR may be influenced by CATECHOL, indicating a potential feedback loop. Reversing TPR \u2192 CATECHOL to CATECHOL \u2192 TPR better reflects this potential bidirectional relationship.

Therefore, we propose to delete this edge. Additionally, we suspect that other relationships involving CO and HR may be more complex than currently modeled, and we also suspect that the relationship between CATECHOL and TPR might be bidirectional, which could be an important consideration for improving the graph. We will design experiments to confirm these hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the effect of LVEDVOLUME on CO is mediated by STROKEVOLUME, implying that the direct edge LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO is likely spurious and should be removed.)\n2. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: CO is a major determinant of BP, and the current graph does not include a direct edge from CO to BP. Including this edge would better capture the physiological relationship between cardiac output and blood pressure.)\n3. REVERSE: TPR \u2192 CATECHOL (Reasoning: Catecholamines can influence total peripheral resistance (TPR), and it is plausible that TPR also influences catecholamine release in response to changes in blood pressure. Reversing this edge would better reflect potential feedback loops in the system.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVEDVOLUME', 'TPR'].

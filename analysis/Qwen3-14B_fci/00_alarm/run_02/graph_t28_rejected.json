The most critical point from the tentative notes is the potential reversal of the edge LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME. Domain knowledge in the alarm domain suggests that LVFAILURE (left ventricular failure) is more likely a consequence of abnormal LVEDVOLUME (left ventricular end-diastolic volume) rather than a cause. This reversal is a high-priority candidate for refinement. Additionally, we suspect that the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and STROKEVOLUME might be mediated by other variables, such as CO (cardiac output), and that the edge TPR \u2192 BP may be over-simplified, as BP is influenced by multiple factors beyond TPR. We propose three candidate operations to investigate these issues.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - TPR -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: Domain knowledge suggests that LVFAILURE is more likely a consequence of abnormal LVEDVOLUME rather than a cause. The current edge LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME may be reversed based on physiological understanding of heart failure and volume status.)\n2. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on STROKEVOLUME may be indirect, mediated through CO. If we observe no direct effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on STROKEVOLUME when conditioning on CO, this edge may be deleted.)\n3. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: While TPR is a known driver of BP, CO also directly influences BP. The current graph does not capture the direct effect of CO on BP, which is a key physiological relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

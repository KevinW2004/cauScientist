This suggests the relationship might be indirect or non-existent. To refine the graph, we consider three key operations: (1) deleting the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP, (2) adding an edge between HYPOVOLEMIA and CVP via a mediator like LVEDVOLUME or CVP itself, and (3) adding an edge between TPR and HR, as TPR is known to influence systemic vascular resistance and could indirectly affect heart rate. Each operation is supported by domain knowledge and statistical evidence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: Marginal evidence contradicts the existence of this direct edge (TVD=0.0840, NOT SIGNIFICANT). This suggests the relationship might be indirect or non-existent, and removing it could improve the graph's accuracy.)\n2. ADD: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: LVEDVOLUME is a known determinant of CVP. If the direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CVP is removed, this indirect pathway via LVEDVOLUME could explain the observed association.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 HR (Reasoning: TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance) is a key factor in blood pressure regulation and can influence heart rate via reflex mechanisms. Adding this edge aligns with physiological understanding and could better explain downstream effects on HRBP and BP.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

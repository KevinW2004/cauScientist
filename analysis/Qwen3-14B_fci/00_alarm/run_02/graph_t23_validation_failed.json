First, the existing edges from STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO and TPR \u2192 CO and TPR \u2192 BP are well-supported by interventional evidence and physiological knowledge, so we focus on other potentially missing or incorrect relationships. We suspect the following changes may improve the graph:\n\n1. **Add an edge from CO to BP**: While TPR \u2192 BP is present, CO also has a direct influence on BP via cardiac output. This is a known physiological relationship where increased CO leads to increased BP, independent of TPR.\n\n2. **Add an edge from PAP to PCWP**: Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) are closely related. PAP can influence PCWP, especially in conditions like pulmonary hypertension or heart failure.\n\n3. **Delete the edge from LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME**: LVEDVOLUME is primarily influenced by HYPOVOLEMIA and other volume-related factors. LVFAILURE may affect cardiac output or stroke volume, but it is not a direct cause of LVEDVOLUME. This edge may be a reverse or spurious relationship.\n\nFor each of these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to validate the causal influence.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - TPR -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: CO has a direct physiological effect on BP. Increasing cardiac output increases systemic blood pressure, independent of TPR. This is a well-established causal relationship in cardiovascular physiology.)\n2. ADD: PAP \u2192 PCWP (Reasoning: PAP can influence PCWP, especially in conditions where pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. This relationship is supported by hemodynamic principles, where PAP is a surrogate for left atrial pressure, which is closely related to PCWP.)\n3. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: LVFAILURE primarily affects cardiac output and stroke volume, not directly the left ventricular end-diastolic volume. LVEDVOLUME is more directly influenced by HYPOVOLEMIA and other volume-related variables. This edge may be a reverse or spurious relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

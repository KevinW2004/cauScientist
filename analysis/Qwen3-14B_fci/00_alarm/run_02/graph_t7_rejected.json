The current graph does not include a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CVP, but the tentative note suggests that marginal evidence contradicts the existence of this edge. This implies that either the edge should be removed or further investigation is needed to determine whether the relationship is indirect or spurious. Additionally, we can consider potential indirect pathways (e.g., HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP) and examine whether adding or reversing other edges might better represent the causal structure. We will focus on three key operations: (1) adding HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP, (2) reversing LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME, and (3) adding TPR \u2192 HRBP to explore indirect pathways.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the absence of a direct edge between HYPOVOLEMIA and CVP may be incorrect. Adding this edge would allow for a direct causal influence of hypovolemia on central venous pressure, which is biologically plausible.)\n2. REVERSE: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: LVFAILURE is currently a cause of LVEDVOLUME, but this may be reversed. In reality, LVFAILURE could result from abnormal LVEDVOLUME, and this reversal may better represent the causal direction based on physiological mechanisms.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: TPR is currently an influence on BP, but HRBP is not directly connected. Given that TPR can affect blood pressure and heart rate, it is plausible that TPR also influences HRBP. Adding this edge would help capture this potential causal relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CVP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

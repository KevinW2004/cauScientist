The most critical issue is the tentative note regarding the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and CVP. The marginal evidence contradicts the existence of a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP, suggesting it may be an indirect or non-existent relationship. Additionally, based on alarm domain knowledge, CVP is influenced by both HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE, and it is also a precursor to STROKEVOLUME and LVEDVOLUME. Therefore, the relationship HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP may not be directly causal and could be an artifact of confounding or indirect influence. We also suspect that CVP may have a direct influence on STROKEVOLUME and LVEDVOLUME, which are currently only influenced by HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE. Finally, we suspect that CVP may be a mediator between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE in some cases, but this is not currently modeled. To verify these, we propose three candidate operations: delete HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP, add CVP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME, and add CVP \u2192 STROKEVOLUME.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: Tentative notes indicate that marginal evidence contradicts the existence of a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CVP. This suggests the relationship may be indirect or non-existent. CVP is more likely influenced by LVFAILURE and other hemodynamic factors, not directly by HYPOVOLEMIA.)\n2. ADD: CVP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: CVP is a measure of right atrial pressure and is closely related to left ventricular end-diastolic volume. Domain knowledge suggests that CVP can influence LVEDVOLUME, either directly or through compensatory mechanisms, which is not currently modeled.)\n3. ADD: CVP \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: CVP reflects preload, which is a known determinant of stroke volume. While HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are currently modeled as direct parents of STROKEVOLUME, CVP may also have a direct causal influence, which is missing from the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

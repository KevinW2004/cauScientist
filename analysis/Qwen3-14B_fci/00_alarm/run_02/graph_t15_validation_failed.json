However, the absence of a direct edge from HR \u2192 CO may be problematic, as heart rate is a key determinant of cardiac output. Adding this edge would better reflect the physiological relationship where increased heart rate contributes to higher cardiac output, assuming stroke volume remains constant. This addition is consistent with domain knowledge and may improve the log-likelihood by capturing a direct causal pathway.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 14):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  MINVOL \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -184009.17117306218\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

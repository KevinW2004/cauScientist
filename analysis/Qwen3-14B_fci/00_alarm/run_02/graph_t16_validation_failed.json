This relationship is critical for understanding how cardiac output is influenced by stroke volume. Additionally, there may be missing or incorrect relationships involving other variables such as HYPOVOLEMIA, LVFAILURE, and TPR. Based on domain knowledge, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are likely to influence TPR indirectly through systemic effects, and TPR may have a more direct influence on BP than currently represented. These relationships warrant further investigation to ensure the graph accurately reflects the underlying causal structure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The edge from STROKEVOLUME to CO is tentatively supported but requires further validation. If this relationship is not direct, removing it could improve the graph by eliminating an unsupported or spurious connection.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA can lead to compensatory vasoconstriction, which increases total peripheral resistance (TPR). Adding this edge aligns with physiological mechanisms and may better capture the causal influence of hypovolemia on systemic blood pressure.)\n3. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: Left ventricular failure can lead to systemic congestion and activation of the renin-angiotensin system, which increases TPR. Including this relationship would provide a more complete causal model of how LVFAILURE influences systemic hemodynamics.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

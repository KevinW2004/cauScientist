The marginal evidence suggests that this edge may not exist, or that the relationship is indirect. Therefore, we consider the possibility of deleting the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP. Additionally, we suspect that HYPOVOLEMIA might have a direct effect on CVP through other physiological pathways not currently represented in the graph, so we consider adding an edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CVP. Lastly, we suspect that TPR might have a direct influence on HRBP, as TPR is a key determinant of systemic vascular resistance and can affect blood pressure, which in turn may influence heart rate and blood pressure variability. We propose experiments to verify these three candidate changes.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: The current graph includes HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP, but the marginal evidence contradicts this edge (TVD=0.0840, NOT SIGNIFICANT). This suggests that the relationship may not be direct and could be mediated or spurious. Removing this edge may improve the graph's accuracy.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: Although the current edge is under question, the physiological relationship between hypovolemia (low blood volume) and central venous pressure (CVP) is plausible. CVP is a measure of the pressure in the right atrium, and hypovolemia can directly reduce CVP. We propose adding this edge to test its presence.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is a major determinant of blood pressure (BP). Since HRBP is a measure of blood pressure variability, it is reasonable to suspect that changes in TPR could influence HRBP. This edge is not currently in the graph and may represent an unmodeled causal relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

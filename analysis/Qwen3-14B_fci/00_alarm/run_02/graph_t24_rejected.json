However, based on domain knowledge and physiological reasoning, there are potential missing or misaligned edges that could be refined. The following candidate operations are proposed for improvement:\n\n1. **Add an edge from LVEDVOLUME to CO**: While the current graph includes STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO, LVEDVOLUME is a known determinant of stroke volume and thus indirectly influences CO. However, in some cases, LVEDVOLUME may directly influence CO through preload effects, especially in the context of heart failure or volume status changes. This edge may be missing and should be considered for addition.\n\n2. **Add an edge from PAP to CO**: Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is a critical indicator of right heart function and pulmonary vascular resistance. It may directly influence cardiac output, especially in conditions like pulmonary embolism or heart failure. This relationship is not currently captured and should be explored.\n\n3. **Delete the edge from TPR to CATECHOL**: While TPR (total peripheral resistance) is known to influence BP and CO, its direct influence on catecholamine levels (CATECHOL) is less direct and more likely mediated through other factors like sympathetic activation. This edge may be spurious or indirect and should be tested for removal.\n\nFor each of these candidate operations, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to confirm the existence or absence of the causal influence.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - TPR -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: LVEDVOLUME (left ventricular end-diastolic volume) is a key determinant of stroke volume and thus may directly influence CO. Adding this edge would better capture the physiological relationship between preload and cardiac output.)\n2. ADD: PAP \u2192 CO (Reasoning: PAP (pulmonary artery pressure) reflects right heart function and pulmonary vascular resistance. It may directly influence CO, especially in pathologies like pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension. This edge is missing and should be validated.)\n3. DELETE: TPR \u2192 CATECHOL (Reasoning: TPR (total peripheral resistance) is primarily influenced by vascular tone and catecholamines, but the reverse relationship (TPR \u2192 CATECHOL) is not directly supported by physiology. This edge may be spurious and should be tested for removal.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(CVP) affects LVEDVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.0620).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192LVEDVOLUME\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

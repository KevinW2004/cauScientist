The tentative note highlights that there is no strong evidence for a direct causal link between ERRLOWOUTPUT and CO, suggesting that this edge should be deleted. We also consider potential missing edges that could better explain the relationships between variables such as HYPOVOLEMIA, LVFAILURE, and BP, as well as TPR and HRBP. These refinements aim to align the graph more closely with the observed data and interventional evidence.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that there is no significant interventional evidence supporting a direct causal relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and CO. This suggests that the edge ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO may be spurious and should be removed.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is known to reduce preload, which can decrease stroke volume and ultimately affect blood pressure. Since STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP is already in the graph, it is plausible that HYPOVOLEMIA could have a direct effect on BP as well, especially through changes in cardiac output and vascular resistance.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is a key determinant of blood pressure. Since TPR \u2192 BP is present, and HRBP (heart rate and blood pressure) are closely related, it is reasonable to hypothesize a direct influence of TPR on HRBP, possibly through reflex mechanisms or autonomic responses.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LVFAILURE', 'HYPOVOLEMIA'], do(PULMEMBOLUS) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.0484).

However, there is a possibility of a direct causal relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and CO, as well as LVFAILURE and CO. These direct relationships could be missed in the current graph if they exist. To improve the graph, we propose three candidate operations: adding a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO, adding a direct edge from LVFAILURE to CO, and verifying the existing edge from STROKEVOLUME to CO. We will design targeted interventional experiments to test for these direct causal influences.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA may directly influence CO, not only through STROKEVOLUME. This is supported by the tentative note that the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO is likely mediated through STROKEVOLUME, but a direct influence cannot be ruled out.)\n2. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: LVFAILURE may directly influence CO, not only through STROKEVOLUME. This is supported by the tentative note that the effect of LVFAILURE on CO is likely mediated through STROKEVOLUME, but a direct influence cannot be ruled out.)\n3. DELETE: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: If HYPOVOLEMIA or LVFAILURE directly influence CO, the current edge from STROKEVOLUME to CO may be redundant or confounded.

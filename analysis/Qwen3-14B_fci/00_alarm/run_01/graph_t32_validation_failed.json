Additionally, we explore other potentially missing or reversed relationships that could improve the model's accuracy. The following candidates are proposed based on domain knowledge and causal reasoning:\n\n1. **ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO**: The tentative note suggests this edge may be spurious or mediated, so we propose deleting it. This will help clarify whether CO is directly influenced by ERRLOWOUTPUT or if the relationship is indirect.\n\n2. **CO \u2192 TPR**: While TPR is currently a parent of CO, it is biologically plausible that CO could influence TPR via systemic vascular resistance feedback mechanisms. This suggests a potential reverse edge.\n\n3. **MINVOL \u2192 VENTLUNG**: The current graph links MINVOLSET to MINVOL, and INTUBATION to VENTLUNG. However, MINVOL (the actual volume delivered) could directly influence VENTLUNG function, especially in the context of mechanical ventilation. Adding this edge could improve the model's accuracy.\n\nFor each of these candidates, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to test their validity.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and CO may be spurious or mediated. Removing this edge will help assess whether CO is directly influenced by ERRLOWOUTPUT or if the relationship is indirect.)\n2. REVERSE: TPR \u2192 CO (Reasoning: There is a plausible biological mechanism by which cardiac output (CO) can influence total peripheral resistance (TPR), particularly through feedback mechanisms in the cardiovascular system. Reversing the edge TPR \u2192 CO to CO \u2192 TPR may better reflect this causal relationship.)\n3. ADD: MINVOL \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: The actual volume delivered (MINVOL) can directly impact lung mechanics and function, especially in the context of mechanical ventilation. Adding an edge from MINVOL to VENTLUNG would better represent this causal influence.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LVFAILURE', 'HYPOVOLEMIA'], do(PULMEMBOLUS) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.0484).

Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192CO\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

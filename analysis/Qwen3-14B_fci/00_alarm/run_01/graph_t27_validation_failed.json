Therefore, this edge should be deleted. Additionally, based on domain knowledge in the alarm domain, there are potential missing causal relationships that could improve the graph's accuracy. For instance, HYPOVOLEMIA may directly influence CO, and TPR may influence HR indirectly through its effect on CO and BP. These relationships are not currently represented in the graph and could be candidates for addition.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that there is no significant interventional effect supporting this edge. This suggests that the relationship is either spurious or mediated by other variables, and thus should be removed to improve the accuracy of the graph.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is known to reduce cardiac output (CO) due to reduced preload. This relationship is not explicitly represented in the current graph, and adding it would align with physiological understanding of the alarm domain.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 HR (Reasoning: Total peripheral resistance (TPR) can influence heart rate (HR) through reflex mechanisms, such as the baroreceptor response. While TPR is currently connected to CO and BP, adding a direct influence from TPR to HR would better capture this physiological interaction.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LVFAILURE', 'HYPOVOLEMIA'], do(PULMEMBOLUS) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.0484).

However, there is a plausible additional causal relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and PCWP (Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure), as hypovolemia can also lead to reduced left atrial pressure, which is reflected in PCWP.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

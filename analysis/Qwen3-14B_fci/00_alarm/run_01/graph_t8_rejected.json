However, the edge from HR \u2192 CO is also present, which is correct as heart rate influences cardiac output. Given the failed attempts to add LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO and the domain knowledge that left ventricular end-diastolic volume directly affects stroke volume, which in turn affects cardiac output, it is likely that LVEDVOLUME indirectly influences CO through STROKEVOLUME. However, based on the constraints, we cannot add LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO directly. Instead, we should examine the existing edge from STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO and consider whether it is sufficient or if reversing HR \u2192 CO might be more plausible. After careful consideration, we will keep the current structure and focus on confirming the edge from STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO, which is well-supported by physiology.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  EXPCO2 \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 EXPCO2\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  CATECHOL \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  SAO2 \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -149880.5441972717\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -153060.8849, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HR', 'CO')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -150006.6150, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LVEDVOLUME', 'STROKEVOLUME')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

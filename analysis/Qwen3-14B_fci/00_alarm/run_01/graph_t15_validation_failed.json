First, the proposed edge 'ERRLOWOUTPUT -> CO' should be deleted, as the note indicates no direct causal relationship is supported. Second, I suspect a missing edge from 'CO' to 'BP' may be necessary, given that CO is a major determinant of BP. Third, I suspect a missing edge from 'VENTTUBE' to 'PRESS', as VENTTUBE status may influence pressure readings. For each of these, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to validate or refute the proposed changes.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates no interventional evidence supports a direct causal link between ERRLOWOUTPUT and CO. Removing this edge aligns with the current evidence and simplifies the graph.)\n2. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Cardiac output (CO) is a key determinant of blood pressure (BP). The current graph has 'STROKEVOLUME -> BP' and 'TPR -> BP', but a direct link from CO to BP is biologically plausible and may improve the model's accuracy.)\n3. ADD: VENTTUBE \u2192 PRESS (Reasoning: The current graph has 'KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS' and 'VENTTUBE' is a component of the ventilatory system. If the ventilator tube is disconnected or kinked, it can influence pressure readings. Therefore, VENTTUBE may directly influence PRESS.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LVFAILURE', 'HYPOVOLEMIA'], do(PULMEMBOLUS) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.0484).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192BP; DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192CO, ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192CO\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

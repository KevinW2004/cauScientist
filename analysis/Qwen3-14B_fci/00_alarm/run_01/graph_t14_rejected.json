This suggests that there may be a direct effect of HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE on CO, or alternatively, that STROKEVOLUME is not a complete mediator. To improve the graph, we should consider adding direct edges from HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE to CO. Additionally, we should check whether there are any unnecessary edges, such as the one from TPR to CATECHOL, which may not be directly causal. Lastly, we should verify whether the edge from ERRLOWOUTPUT to HRBP is direct or if there is a mediating variable we are missing.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that HYPOVOLEMIA influences CO through STROKEVOLUME, but it is possible that there is a direct effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO that is not currently represented in the graph.)\n2. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Similar to HYPOVOLEMIA, LVFAILURE may have a direct effect on CO in addition to its influence through STROKEVOLUME. This direct effect may be important for a more accurate causal model.)\n3. DELETE: TPR \u2192 CATECHOL (Reasoning: There is no clear physiological basis for a direct causal relationship between total peripheral resistance (TPR) and catecholamines (CATECHOL). This edge may be spurious and should be tested.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'CO'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0000).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

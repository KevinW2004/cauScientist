Since CO is a critical variable influenced by cardiac output, it is plausible that both HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE directly affect CO. Additionally, the current graph lacks a direct edge from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO and from LVFAILURE to CO, which could explain some unaccounted variance in CO. To verify these potential direct relationships, targeted interventional experiments are necessary. We propose adding these edges and testing their validity through controlled interventions.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Tentative notes suggest that HYPOVOLEMIA may have a direct or indirect influence on CO. Adding this edge would better represent the potential causal pathway from hypovolemia to cardiac output.)\n2. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: LVFAILURE is a known cause of reduced cardiac output, and the tentative notes suggest that the effect may be mediated through intermediate variables. Adding this edge allows for testing whether the effect is direct or mediated.)\n3. DELETE: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: While STROKEVOLUME is a known contributor to CO, the tentative notes suggest that the influence of HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE on CO may bypass STROKEVOLUME or be mediated through other variables. Removing this edge could help clarify the direct influence of other variables on CO.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'CO'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0000).

Based on domain knowledge and the structure of the graph, the following candidate operations are proposed:\n\n1. **Add**: PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 CO. Pulmonary embolism is known to reduce cardiac output (CO) by obstructing pulmonary blood flow, which directly impacts the heart's ability to pump blood. This relationship is likely missing in the current graph.\n\n2. **Add**: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 HR. Hypovolemia (low blood volume) typically triggers an increase in heart rate (HR) as a compensatory mechanism. This direct causal link is not currently represented.\n\n3. **Delete**: TPR \u2192 BP. While total peripheral resistance (TPR) influences blood pressure (BP), this relationship may be indirect or confounded by other variables such as cardiac output (CO) or heart rate (HR). In the current graph, TPR is only connected to CATECHOL, not directly to BP. Removing this edge would better reflect the true causal dependencies.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed for each candidate operation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Pulmonary embolism directly reduces cardiac output by increasing right ventricular afterload and decreasing pulmonary blood flow. This is a well-established physiological relationship that should be represented in the causal graph.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 HR (Reasoning: Hypovolemia triggers sympathetic activation, which increases heart rate as a compensatory mechanism. This is a direct causal relationship that is not currently represented in the graph.)\n3. DELETE: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Blood pressure is primarily determined by cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (TPR), but the direct effect of TPR on BP may be confounded by other variables (e.g., CO). This edge may not represent a direct causal influence and should be removed.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['LVFAILURE', 'HYPOVOLEMIA'], do(PULMEMBOLUS) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.0484). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['TPR', 'CATECHOL'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects HR (avg_TVD=0.0393). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['CO', 'HR', 'LVFAILURE']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(TPR) affects BP (TVD=0.0568). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -186988.5342058724\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

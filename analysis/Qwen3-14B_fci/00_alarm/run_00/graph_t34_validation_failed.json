However, the influence of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO is likely mediated through its effect on STROKEVOLUME and LVEDVOLUME. Since STROKEVOLUME is already connected to CO, but the edge from STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO has previously failed to be added, we should instead examine whether the existing edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO is truly direct or if it should be removed in favor of a more indirect path via STROKEVOLUME. This would better align with the physiological mechanism where hypovolemia reduces stroke volume, which in turn reduces cardiac output.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CO\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 14):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180233.8186630248\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: ADD operation failed: edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: LL too low: -180332.1912, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LVEDVOLUME', 'CO')]\nAttempt 16: ADD operation failed: edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 19: DELETE operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

First, the tentative note suggests that LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME is physiologically plausible via the Frank-Starling mechanism, but we should confirm it is a direct effect and not mediated by other variables. Second, the note also highlights that PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG is supported by interventional evidence, but we should verify that no intermediate variables are mediating this relationship. Lastly, the current graph lacks a direct edge from LVEDVOLUME to CO, which is indirectly connected via STROKEVOLUME. However, since LVEDVOLUME is a key determinant of stroke volume and CO, we should consider adding a direct edge from LVEDVOLUME to CO to better reflect the causal structure.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: LVEDVOLUME is a critical determinant of stroke volume and CO. While the current graph connects LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO, a direct causal influence from LVEDVOLUME to CO may also exist, especially under certain pathological conditions such as heart failure or hypovolemia, which directly affect cardiac output.)\n2. REVERSE: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME is a direct causal relationship. However, in the current graph, STROKEVOLUME is a parent of LVEDVOLUME, which contradicts this. Reversing this edge would align the graph with the Frank-Starling mechanism and interventional evidence.)\n3. DELETE: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG is supported by interventional evidence, but we need to confirm that no intermediate variables (e.g., VENTALV or VENTTUBE) are mediating this relationship. If such intermediates exist, the direct edge from PRESS to VENTLUNG may be spurious.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

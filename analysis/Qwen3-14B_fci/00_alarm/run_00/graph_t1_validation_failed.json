However, based on domain knowledge and causal reasoning, there are several potential improvements to consider. First, the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE may not be directly causal but could be confounded by a shared cause, such as HISTORY. Second, the relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and HR is present, but it is unclear whether ERRLOWOUTPUT directly influences HR or if this is a mediated effect through other variables like CO or BP. Third, the relationship between KINKEDTUBE and PRESS may be indirect, as KINKEDTUBE could influence PRESS through VENTTUBE, which is already a parent of PRESS. Therefore, we propose three candidate operations to refine the graph.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVFAILURE (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both precursors to LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. It is unlikely that HYPOVOLEMIA directly causes LVFAILURE. Instead, they may share a common cause, such as HISTORY or other underlying pathophysiological conditions. Removing this edge would better reflect the possibility of a confounding relationship.)\n2. REVERSE: HR \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT is an error signal that may be triggered by changes in hemodynamics, including HR. However, HR is more likely to be a cause of ERRLOWOUTPUT rather than the reverse. Reversing this edge aligns with the idea that physiological changes (like HR) can trigger error signals, not the other way around.)\n3. DELETE: KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS (Reasoning: KINKEDTUBE influences PRESS indirectly through its effect on VENTTUBE, which is already a direct parent of PRESS. Removing the direct edge from KINKEDTUBE to PRESS would simplify the graph and avoid over-specifying the causal pathways.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME (TVD=0.1756). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['VENTMACH', 'VENTTUBE'], do(KINKEDTUBE) affects PRESS (avg_TVD=0.5385). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'CO']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(ERRLOWOUTPUT) affects LVFAILURE (TVD=0.0006). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HISTORY'], do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects LVFAILURE (avg_TVD=0.0083). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['CO', 'BP'], do(HR) affects ERRLOWOUTPUT (avg_TVD=0.0266). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['VENTTUBE'], do(KINKEDTUBE) affects PRESS (avg_TVD=0.2964).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

Additionally, I identify two other candidate relationships that may be missing or misrepresented in the graph. First, I suspect that 'CO \u2192 BP' may be a direct causal relationship, as cardiac output is a major determinant of blood pressure. Second, I suspect that 'TPR \u2192 CO' might be reversed or misrepresented, as total peripheral resistance typically affects blood pressure more directly than cardiac output, and CO is more influenced by stroke volume and heart rate. I will propose experiments to verify each of these three candidate changes.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: This edge is supported by physiological mechanisms and interventional evidence. Pressures in the ventilatory system can directly influence lung mechanics, and this relationship is critical for understanding ventilator-induced lung injury and respiratory function.)\n2. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Cardiac output (CO) is a primary determinant of blood pressure (BP). If CO increases, BP is expected to increase, assuming other factors are constant. This relationship is central to hemodynamic regulation and should be included in the graph.)\n3. REVERSE: CO \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: The current graph has TPR \u2192 CO, but TPR is more likely to be influenced by CO and other factors such as vasoactive drugs. It is more plausible that CO influences TPR indirectly through reflex mechanisms, or that TPR influences CO through afterload effects. A reversal or removal of this edge may better represent the true causal direction.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

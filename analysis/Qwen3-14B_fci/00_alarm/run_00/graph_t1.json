First, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both known to affect LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, but there may be a direct causal influence from LVEDVOLUME to STROKEVOLUME as well. Second, the current graph lacks a direct causal link between STROKEVOLUME and CO (Cardiac Output), which is a core physiological relationship. Third, the influence of PRESS on VENTLUNG is not captured in the current graph, but based on clinical knowledge, changes in pressure can affect lung mechanics. These three relationships\u2014LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME, STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO, and PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG\u2014are strong candidates for addition to improve the graph.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: LVEDVOLUME (left ventricular end-diastolic volume) directly influences STROKEVOLUME (the volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle per beat) through the Frank-Starling mechanism. This is a well-established physiological relationship that should be explicitly modeled.)\n2. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Cardiac Output (CO) is calculated as the product of STROKEVOLUME and heart rate (HR). Therefore, STROKEVOLUME directly influences CO, and this relationship should be included in the graph.)\n3. ADD: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: PRESS (systemic arterial pressure) can affect lung mechanics and ventilation dynamics, particularly in the context of positive pressure ventilation. Including this causal link will better represent the interactions between circulatory and respiratory systems.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HR'], do(STROKEVOLUME) affects CO (avg_TVD=0.3840). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['VENTMACH', 'VENTTUBE'], do(PRESS) affects VENTLUNG (avg_TVD=0.2980). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -186988.5342058724\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

Based on the previous tentative note, the edge 'PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG' is supported by interventional evidence and should be considered for addition. Additionally, there are other potential relationships that could be added or modified to better reflect the causal structure. For example, the variable 'MINVOLSET' may influence 'MINVOL', and 'VENTALV' may influence 'VENTLUNG'. Another potential edge is between 'STROKEVOLUME' and 'BP', as stroke volume is a major determinant of blood pressure. These relationships should be tested experimentally to confirm their existence or absence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: This edge is supported by interventional evidence and aligns with the physiological mechanism that increased pressure can affect lung mechanics during ventilation.)\n2. ADD: MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL (Reasoning: Setting the minimum volume (MINVOLSET) is expected to directly influence the actual minimum volume (MINVOL) delivered by the ventilator.)\n3. ADD: VENTALV \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: Ventilator valve settings (VENTALV) are likely to directly influence the mechanics of the lungs during ventilation.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR.

The note indicates that the effect of ERRLOWOUTPUT on CO is not significant, suggesting that the relationship may be indirect or nonexistent. Therefore, the edge 'ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO' should be deleted. Additionally, the graph lacks a direct causal link between 'STROKEVOLUME' and 'BP', which is a key hemodynamic relationship. Also, 'HRBP' is currently only influenced by 'ERRLOWOUTPUT', but it may also be influenced by 'BP' directly, which is a plausible physiological relationship. These three candidate changes aim to refine the graph based on physiological plausibility and interventional evidence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: The tentative note explicitly states that interventional evidence does not support a direct causal link between ERRLOWOUTPUT and CO, suggesting the relationship may be indirect or nonexistent. Removing this edge aligns with the evidence and improves the graph's accuracy.)\n2. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Stroke volume is a key determinant of cardiac output, and cardiac output in turn influences blood pressure. Given that CO is already linked to BP, it is physiologically plausible that STROKEVOLUME could have a direct influence on BP as well, especially through changes in systemic perfusion and vascular resistance.)\n3. ADD: BP \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: HRBP (heart rate blood pressure) is likely influenced by BP itself. If BP changes, it would directly affect HRBP. This direct link is both physiologically reasonable and would better represent the causal relationship in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['LVFAILURE', 'TPR'].

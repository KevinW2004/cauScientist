The first is the addition of the edge 'PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG' as highlighted in the notes, which is supported by interventional evidence and physiological plausibility. The second is the addition of a direct causal relationship between 'STROKEVOLUME' and 'CO', which is already present in the graph but may need reinforcement with experimental validation. The third is the potential deletion of the edge 'TPR \u2192 CATECHOL', as it may be an indirect or spurious relationship that lacks strong interventional support. For each of these changes, I have designed an interventional experiment to validate the proposed causal influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: The tentative note explicitly supports the addition of this edge based on interventional evidence and physiological mechanisms. Adding this edge improves the causal accuracy of the graph by capturing the direct influence of pressure changes on lung mechanics during ventilation.)\n2. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO (Reasoning: While the edge 'STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO' is already present in the graph, it is a critical link in the causal chain from cardiac function to systemic circulation. Reinforcing this relationship with experimental validation ensures that the graph remains grounded in physiological reality.)\n3. DELETE: TPR \u2192 CATECHOL (Reasoning: The relationship between total peripheral resistance (TPR) and catecholamine levels (CATECHOL) is not clearly supported by interventional data or direct physiological pathways. Deleting this edge may simplify the graph and improve its accuracy by removing potentially spurious influences.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

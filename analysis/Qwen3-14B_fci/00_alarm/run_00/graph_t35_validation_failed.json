However, there are potential missing or questionable edges that could be refined. Based on the notes, the direct edge STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP is confirmed, but CO may mediate this relationship. This suggests that CO could be a mediator, but the direct edge remains. Other possible candidate changes include adding a direct effect of PAP on BP, which is plausible due to its role in pulmonary circulation and systemic pressure. Additionally, the relationship between HR and BP is not explicitly modeled, but HR is a key determinant of BP. Lastly, the effect of MINVOLSET on MINVOL may be direct, though it is not currently included in the graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  - INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  - PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  - FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  - TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  - TPR \u2192 BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PAP \u2192 BP (Reasoning: PAP (Pulmonary Artery Pressure) is a key hemodynamic parameter that reflects the pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Changes in PAP can influence systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, which in turn affect BP. Including this direct edge captures a potential causal pathway from pulmonary circulation to systemic blood pressure.)\n2. ADD: HR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Heart rate (HR) directly influences cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. A higher HR increases the rate of blood ejection from the heart, which can elevate BP, especially in the context of other factors like CO and TPR. This direct effect is likely missing in the current graph.)\n3. ADD: MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL (Reasoning: MINVOLSET represents the ventilator setting for minimum volume, while MINVOL represents the actual delivered minimum volume. It is reasonable to expect that the ventilator setting directly influences the delivered volume, making this a direct causal relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CO\u2192BP, TPR\u2192CO, CO\u2192BP; DELETE: CO\u2192BP; REVERSE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, based on the tentative notes, there are three key relationships that may need refinement: (1) whether LVEDVOLUME directly influences STROKEVOLUME, (2) whether PRESS directly influences VENTLUNG, and (3) whether there is a missing causal link from CO to BP, which is physiologically plausible as cardiac output directly affects blood pressure. These candidate changes aim to ensure the graph accurately represents direct causal influences without unaccounted mediators or missing links.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: CO (cardiac output) is a major determinant of BP (blood pressure) through the relationship BP = CO \u00d7 TPR. While TPR is already connected to BP, CO is also a direct driver of BP, and this link is missing in the current graph. Adding this edge would better reflect the physiological relationship.)\n2. REVERSE: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME is plausible via the Frank-Starling mechanism. However, the current graph has the reverse (STROKEVOLUME \u2192 LVEDVOLUME), which is physiologically implausible. Reversing this edge aligns with the known causal direction of the Frank-Starling mechanism.)\n3. DELETE: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG is supported by interventional evidence but requires confirmation that no intermediate variables are mediating this effect. If an experiment shows that PRESS does not directly influence VENTLUNG, this edge should be deleted.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Based on the tentative note, the edge 'PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG' is a candidate for addition due to interventional evidence and physiological plausibility. Additionally, we observe that several variables related to the ventilatory system (e.g., DISCONNECT, VENTMACH, KINKEDTUBE, PRESS) may influence each other in ways not fully captured. For instance, KINKEDTUBE may also influence VENTLUNG, and DISCONNECT may influence PRESS. Lastly, the relationship between TPR \u2192 BP is present, but the influence of CO on BP may be missing, as CO is a key determinant of BP. These three candidate changes (ADD) are proposed for further experimental validation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: PRESS is a measure of pressure within the ventilatory system, and increased pressure can directly affect lung mechanics and ventilation, thus influencing VENTLUNG. This edge is supported by physiological reasoning and aligns with the tentative note.)\n2. ADD: KINKEDTUBE \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: A kinked tube would obstruct airflow, leading to changes in lung pressure and mechanics, thereby directly affecting VENTLUNG. This relationship is physiologically plausible and may be missing from the current graph.)\n3. ADD: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Cardiac output (CO) is a major determinant of blood pressure (BP), and while TPR \u2192 BP is included, the direct influence of CO on BP is not represented. This is a critical relationship in cardiovascular physiology and should be considered.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

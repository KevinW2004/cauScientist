The first candidate change addresses the potential direct relationship between LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, which is supported by the Frank-Starling mechanism but may require confirmation of no intermediate variables. The second candidate change involves adding a direct link from PRESS to VENTLUNG, as interventional evidence supports this relationship, and the current graph lacks it. The third candidate change involves reversing the direction of the relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and HRBP, as the current direction may not reflect the true causal influence, and this reversal could better align with observed physiological responses.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: PRESS \u2192 VENTLUNG (Reasoning: Interventional evidence supports a direct causal influence of PRESS on VENTLUNG, likely due to the mechanical and pressure dynamics within the ventilatory system. Adding this edge improves the graph's accuracy and aligns with known physiological pathways.)\n2. ADD: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME (Reasoning: The Frank-Starling mechanism suggests a direct relationship between left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDVOLUME) and stroke volume (STROKEVOLUME). This relationship is supported by interventional studies, and adding it improves the graph's fidelity to physiological reality.)\n3. REVERSE: HRBP \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: The current graph depicts ERRLOWOUTPUT as a parent of HRBP, implying that low output causes a change in heart rate and blood pressure. However, in reality, HRBP may be a response to low output, and reversing the direction could better reflect the causal influence of HRBP on ERRLOWOUTPUT, such as through alarm systems or physiological feedback loops.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['HYPOVOLEMIA', 'LVFAILURE'], do(LVEDVOLUME) affects STROKEVOLUME (avg_TVD=0.1979).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

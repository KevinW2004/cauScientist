Based on domain knowledge, HRBP (hypotension) is primarily influenced by CO (cardiac output), and CO is directly influenced by STROKEVOLUME. While the edge from CO \u2192 HRBP is present, the edge from ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP may be redundant or based on a less direct causal mechanism. Since previous attempts to remove or reverse this edge have failed, we will instead explore adding a more direct causal relationship that aligns with the physiological mechanism, such as adding an edge from CO to BP, which is a well-established relationship in cardiovascular physiology.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CO -> HRBP\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 20):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CO \u2192 HRBP\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179173.3108645584\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180566.3843, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'ERRLOWOUTPUT', 'HRBP')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192HRBP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

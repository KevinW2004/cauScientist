This implies that 'STROKEVOLUME' may not have a direct causal effect on 'BP' once 'CO' is accounted for. Therefore, the edge 'STROKEVOLUME -> BP' should be considered for deletion. Additionally, I identify two other potential improvements: (1) the lack of a direct causal link from 'HYPOVOLEMIA' to 'CO' may be missing, and (2) the absence of a causal link from 'LVFAILURE' to 'CO' may also be an omission. These relationships are plausible based on domain knowledge, as both hypovolemia and left ventricular failure can reduce stroke volume, which in turn affects cardiac output (CO). I will design targeted interventional experiments to verify these proposed changes.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship between STROKEVOLUME and BP may be fully mediated by CO. If CO is a mediator, then STROKEVOLUME may not have a direct causal effect on BP.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA reduces stroke volume, which in turn reduces CO. Therefore, a direct causal link from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO is plausible and likely missing from the current graph.)\n3. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: LVFAILURE reduces stroke volume, which in turn reduces CO. Therefore, a direct causal link from LVFAILURE to CO is plausible and likely missing from the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['BP', 'HR'], do(CO) affects HRBP (avg_TVD=0.0852).

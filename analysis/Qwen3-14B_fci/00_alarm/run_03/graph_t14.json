First, I suspect that CO influences BP directly, which in turn influences HRBP, so the direct link from CO to HRBP should be removed. Second, I suspect that STROKEVOLUME may influence BP directly, as it contributes to cardiac output and systemic pressure. Finally, I suspect that HYPOVOLEMIA may influence TPR (total peripheral resistance) due to compensatory vasoconstriction, which is a known physiological response to low blood volume. These three relationships are candidates for modification to improve the graph's accuracy.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CO \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: The relationship from CO to HRBP is likely indirect and mediated by BP. Removing this direct edge will better align the graph with the physiological mechanism where CO affects BP, which in turn affects HRBP.)\n2. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Stroke volume is a major contributor to cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. Adding this edge reflects the direct influence of stroke volume on BP, which is supported by cardiovascular physiology.)\n3. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can lead to compensatory vasoconstriction, increasing total peripheral resistance. This relationship is well-documented in circulatory physiology and should be included in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['BP', 'HR'], do(CO) affects HRBP (avg_TVD=0.0852).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

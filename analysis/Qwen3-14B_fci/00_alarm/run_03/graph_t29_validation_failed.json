This implies that STROKEVOLUME may have a direct effect on BP independent of CO. To validate this, we should test whether the effect of STROKEVOLUME on BP persists even after conditioning on CO. If it does, then the current graph is missing a direct edge from STROKEVOLUME to BP, and we should add it. Additionally, we should consider the possibility of a direct effect of TPR on BP, as it is currently only connected through CO. Finally, we should also test whether CO is a mediator between STROKEVOLUME and BP, which would justify its presence in the graph as a mediator.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP may not be fully mediated by CO, indicating a possible direct causal influence of STROKEVOLUME on BP. Adding this edge would better represent the observed causal relationship.)\n2. ADD: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: TPR is currently only connected to BP via CO. If TPR has a direct effect on BP, this would explain some of the variance in BP independently of CO. Adding this edge would improve the graph's accuracy.)\n3. DELETE: CO \u2192 BP (Reasoning: If the effect of STROKEVOLUME on BP is not mediated by CO, and TPR also has a direct effect on BP, then CO may not be a necessary mediator of BP. We should test whether CO has a direct effect on BP or if it is fully mediated by other variables.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['BP', 'HR'], do(CO) affects HRBP (avg_TVD=0.0852).

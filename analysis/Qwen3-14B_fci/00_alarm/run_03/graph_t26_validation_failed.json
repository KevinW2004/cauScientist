While the edge from CO \u2192 HRBP is present, the edge from ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP may be redundant or based on a less direct causal mechanism. Since previous attempts to remove or reverse this edge have failed, we will instead explore adding a more direct causal relationship that aligns with the physiological mechanism, such as adding an edge from CO to BP, which is a well-established relationship in cardiovascular physiology.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CO -> HRBP\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 20):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CO \u2192 HRBP\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179173.3108645584\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180566.3843, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'ERRLOWOUTPUT', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CO \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -179722.4237, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'BP', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: CO\u2192BP, BP\u2192HRBP, BP\u2192HRBP, BP\u2192HRBP; DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192HRBP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

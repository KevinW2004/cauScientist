However, based on domain knowledge and potential missing or misaligned relationships, three candidate changes are proposed to refine the graph further. These changes are based on known physiological pathways, potential confounding variables, and direct causal influences that may not be fully captured in the current graph.\n\n1. **Add: TPR \u2192 CO** \u2013 Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) is a key determinant of cardiac output (CO) alongside stroke volume and heart rate. While CO is influenced by HR and STROKEVOLUME, TPR directly affects systemic vascular resistance, which in turn influences CO. This relationship is likely missing in the current graph and should be added.\n\n2. **Delete: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP** \u2013 Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) is a clinical estimate of left atrial pressure and is often used to assess left ventricular function. However, LVEDVOLUME is a measure of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, not pressure. PCWP is more directly influenced by left atrial pressure, which is affected by LVFAILURE, not LVEDVOLUME. This edge may be a misrepresentation of the actual causal mechanism.\n\n3. **Reverse: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP** \u2013 The current graph suggests that ERRLOWOUTPUT causes HRBP (hypotension). However, hypotension (HRBP) is more likely a downstream effect of low cardiac output, not a cause of it. Reversing this edge would better represent the causal direction, where HRBP is a consequence of ERRLOWOUTPUT rather than its cause.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: TPR \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) directly influences systemic vascular resistance, which in turn affects cardiac output (CO). This relationship is a well-established physiological mechanism and is missing in the current graph.)\n2. DELETE: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP (Reasoning: LVEDVOLUME is a volume measure, while PCWP is a pressure measure. PCWP is more directly influenced by left atrial pressure, which is affected by LVFAILURE, not LVEDVOLUME. This edge may be a misrepresentation of the actual causal mechanism.)\n3. REVERSE: HRBP \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: Hypotension (HRBP) is a downstream consequence of low cardiac output (ERRLOWOUTPUT), not its cause. Reversing the edge would better reflect the true causal direction.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['CO', 'BP'], do(LVFAILURE) affects HYPOVOLEMIA (avg_TVD=0.0584).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192TPR, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192TPR; DELETE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL, LVFAILURE\u2192LVEDVOLUME; REVERSE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CO\u2192BP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

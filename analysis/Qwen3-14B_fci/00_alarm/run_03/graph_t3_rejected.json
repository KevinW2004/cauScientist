The goal is to represent direct causal relationships that align with medical and engineering knowledge, while ensuring the graph remains a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\nStarting with physiological variables, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are known to directly affect LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, which aligns with the FCI suggestions. Similarly, PULMEMBOLUS and INTUBATION influence SHUNT, and KINKEDTUBE and VENTMACH influence VENTTUBE. These are direct effects based on clinical understanding.\n\nFor technical and alarm-related variables, ERRLOWOUTPUT, ERRCAUTER, and others are likely outcomes of system failures or events (e.g., HRBP is affected by ERRLOWOUTPUT, and HREKG and HRSAT by ERRCAUTER). These are direct effects from the system's perspective.\n\nVariables like TPR influence CATECHOL and BP, reflecting the body's response to vascular resistance. Similarly, FIO2 directly affects PVSAT, and INTUBATION affects VENTLUNG, which is a direct mechanical relationship.\n\nI avoid including indirect or spurious relationships, such as assuming HYPOVOLEMIA causes LVFAILURE, unless there is strong evidence or interventional data. I also ensure no cycles are introduced by carefully checking the directionality of each edge.\n\nFinally, variables with no known direct causes (e.g., HISTORY, MINVOLSET) are treated as root nodes, while others are connected based on their direct causal influences.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -172248.92399865578\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -176240.9580, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LVEDVOLUME', 'PCWP')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -172296.1362, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'PULMEMBOLUS', 'PCWP')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

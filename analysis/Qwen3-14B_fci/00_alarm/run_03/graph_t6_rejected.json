Here are three candidate changes that I suspect will improve the graph:\n\n1. **Add**: `HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR`. Hypovolemia (low blood volume) can lead to compensatory vasoconstriction, increasing total peripheral resistance (TPR) as the body tries to maintain blood pressure. This relationship is biologically plausible and not currently represented in the graph.\n\n2. **Delete**: `LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME`. Left ventricular failure typically results in reduced stroke volume and may lead to increased LVEDVOLUME (left ventricular end-diastolic volume) due to impaired ejection, but it is not a direct cause of LVEDVOLUME. The current graph may be over-representing this causal influence.\n\n3. **Reverse**: `CO \u2192 BP`. While cardiac output (CO) is a major determinant of blood pressure (BP), the relationship is often mediated by other factors like TPR and systemic vascular resistance. The current graph may be oversimplifying this relationship by treating it as a direct effect. A more accurate representation might be that BP influences CO through reflex mechanisms, or that the relationship is bidirectional and mediated by other variables.\n\nTo verify these changes, the following interventional experiments are proposed:\n\n- For the ADD operation (`HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR`), we would induce hypovolemia and observe whether TPR increases, while controlling for other confounders like HR and CO.\n\n- For the DELETE operation (`LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME`), we would induce LV failure and observe whether LVEDVOLUME changes, while controlling for other variables like HYPOVOLEMIA and CO.\n\n- For the REVERSE operation (`CO \u2192 BP`), we would manipulate BP directly (e.g., via vasoactive drugs) and observe whether CO changes, while controlling for other variables like HR and TPR.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can lead to compensatory vasoconstriction, increasing total peripheral resistance (TPR) as the body attempts to maintain blood pressure. This causal relationship is biologically plausible and not currently represented in the graph.)\n2. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME (Reasoning: LVFAILURE typically results in reduced stroke volume, not a direct cause of LVEDVOLUME. The current graph may be over-representing this causal influence.)\n3. REVERSE: BP \u2192 CO (Reasoning: While CO influences BP, the relationship is often bidirectional and mediated by other factors like TPR.

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

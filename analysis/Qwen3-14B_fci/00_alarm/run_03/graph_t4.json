This suggests that the direct causal influence of CO on HRBP might not exist, and the observed relationship could be due to a confounding path (e.g., CO \u2192 BP \u2192 HRBP). Therefore, I propose removing the direct edge from CO to HRBP. Additionally, I observe that PVSAT is influenced by FIO2, but there may be a missing direct influence from SAO2 to PVSAT, as both are measures of oxygen saturation and could be related. Lastly, I suspect that MINVOLSET may directly influence MINVOL, as MINVOLSET is a setting that determines the minimum volume delivered, which should directly affect the actual MINVOL. These three changes aim to refine the graph by removing spurious edges, adding plausible direct influences, and aligning with domain knowledge.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CO \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the relationship CO \u2192 HRBP is likely indirect and mediated by other variables such as BP. This suggests the direct edge may not exist and should be removed.)\n2. ADD: SAO2 \u2192 PVSAT (Reasoning: Both SAO2 and PVSAT are measures of oxygen saturation. Given that FIO2 influences PVSAT, it is plausible that SAO2 also directly influences PVSAT, possibly through a shared physiological pathway.)\n3. ADD: MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL (Reasoning: MINVOLSET is a parameter that sets the minimum volume to be delivered, which should directly influence the actual MINVOL. This relationship is consistent with domain knowledge in ventilator systems.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['BP', 'HR'], do(CO) affects HRBP (avg_TVD=0.0852).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: CO\u2192HRBP, CO\u2192HRBP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

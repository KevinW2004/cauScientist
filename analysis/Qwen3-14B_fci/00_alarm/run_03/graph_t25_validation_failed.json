Additionally, the graph lacks explicit connections between key variables like HYPOVOLEMIA and TPR, which may be important in understanding systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. There is also no explicit relationship between ERRLOWOUTPUT and CO, which could be relevant given that low output might affect cardiac function. These three candidate changes (one modification and two additions) are proposed to refine the causal structure and improve the model\u2019s accuracy.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates uncertainty about the direct effect of STROKEVOLUME on BP, suggesting that CO may fully mediate this relationship. Removing this edge would test whether the effect of STROKEVOLUME on BP is indeed indirect through CO.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can lead to compensatory vasoconstriction, which increases total peripheral resistance (TPR). Including this edge would better capture the physiological response to low blood volume.)\n3. ADD: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Low output (ERRLOWOUTPUT) is a clinical error that may reflect reduced cardiac output (CO). Adding this edge would establish a direct causal link between the error and the physiological variable it represents.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['BP', 'HR'], do(CO) affects HRBP (avg_TVD=0.0852).

First, the tentative note mentions a potential direct relationship between CO2 and CO2Report, which is currently not represented in the graph. Second, the relationship between LungParench and Disease is not explicitly modeled, but given that LungParench is influenced by CO2 and LungFlow is a known contributor to Disease, it is plausible that LungParench could also be a direct cause of Disease. Third, the variable HypoxiaInO2 is not connected to any other variables in the current graph, but it is a key indicator of oxygenation and could influence LungParench or even Disease directly. Each of these relationships can be tested through targeted interventional experiments.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that CO2 has a direct or mediated influence on CO2Report. Adding this edge would allow for a more accurate representation of the causal influence of CO2 on reporting, which is critical for clinical interpretation.)\n2. ADD: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: LungParench is a measure of lung parenchymal health, and given its influence by CO2 and the known role of lung function in disease progression, it is reasonable to suspect that LungParench directly contributes to Disease.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a direct measure of oxygenation, which is closely related to lung parenchymal health. Therefore, it is plausible that HypoxiaInO2 has a direct influence on LungParench.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'LVH', 'LungFlow', 'Sick', 'Age'].

Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

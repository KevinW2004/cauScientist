The tentative notes suggest that the first two relationships may be indirect or spurious, while the third has strong evidence for a direct causal link. To refine the graph, I propose the following operations: (1) DELETE the edge LungParench \u2192 Disease, (2) DELETE the edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report, and (3) ADD an edge from HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench, as HypoxiaInO2 is a plausible upstream cause of LungParench. Each of these operations is supported by the tentative notes and domain knowledge, and experiments are designed to test the causal validity of the proposed changes.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: Marginal evidence suggests no significant effect of do(LungParench) on Disease, indicating the relationship may be indirect or spurious. Removing this edge could improve the graph by eliminating an unsupported direct causal link.)\n2. DELETE: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: Marginal evidence suggests no significant effect of do(CO2) on CO2Report, indicating the relationship may be indirect or spurious. This edge may represent a reporting artifact rather than a direct causal influence.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a known cause of lung parenchymal changes, and adding this edge provides a plausible upstream explanation for LungParench, which may help explain its current relationship with Disease through a more direct causal pathway.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'LVH', 'LungFlow', 'Sick', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HypoxiaInO2\u2192CO2; DELETE: LungParench\u2192Disease, LungParench\u2192Disease, LungParench\u2192Disease, LungParench\u2192Disease\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

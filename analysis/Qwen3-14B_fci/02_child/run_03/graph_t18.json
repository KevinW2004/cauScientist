This suggests that the current graph may not fully capture the causal pathway. Additionally, we notice that CO2 is connected to LungParench, and CO2Report is not connected to any other variables, which may suggest a missing direct link between CO2 and CO2Report. We also observe that LungFlow influences ChestXray, but there is no explicit link between LungFlow and XrayReport, which may be an oversight. Finally, GruntingReport is influenced by Grunting, but there is no link between GruntingReport and Disease, which could be a missing connection given that Grunting is a clinical sign of disease.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that CO2 may have a direct causal influence on CO2Report, and this relationship needs to be validated. Adding this edge would allow for a more complete representation of the causal process.)\n2. ADD: LungFlow \u2192 XrayReport (Reasoning: Since LungFlow influences ChestXray, and XrayReport is derived from ChestXray, it is plausible that LungFlow also influences XrayReport. Adding this edge would better represent the causal flow of information.)\n3. ADD: GruntingReport \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: GruntingReport is a reported clinical sign, and Grunting itself is a symptom of Disease. It is reasonable to suspect that GruntingReport, as a documented symptom, could have a direct influence on Disease diagnosis or progression.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'LVH', 'LungFlow', 'Sick', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

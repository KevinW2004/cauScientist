The first two relationships show marginal or no significant effect under intervention, suggesting they may be indirect or spurious. The third relationship has strong evidence supporting a direct causal link. To refine the graph, I will consider deleting the first two edges and confirming their absence through targeted experiments, while retaining the third edge as it is supported by evidence. Additionally, I will investigate whether any new direct causal relationships may exist, such as between CO2 and HypoxiaInO2, based on domain knowledge of respiratory physiology.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: Marginal evidence suggests no significant effect of do(LungParench) on Disease, indicating the relationship may be indirect or spurious. Deleting this edge would align the graph with the observed evidence.)\n2. DELETE: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: Marginal evidence suggests no significant effect of do(CO2) on CO2Report, indicating the relationship may be indirect or spurious. Deleting this edge would improve the causal model's accuracy.)\n3. ADD: CO2 \u2192 HypoxiaInO2 (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, CO2 levels can influence oxygenation and hypoxia. Adding this edge would capture a potential direct causal relationship between CO2 and HypoxiaInO2.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'LVH', 'LungFlow', 'Sick', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

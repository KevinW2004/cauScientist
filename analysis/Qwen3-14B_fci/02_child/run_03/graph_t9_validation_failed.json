First, the relationship between LungParench and Disease was flagged as potentially indirect or spurious. Second, CO2 and CO2Report show no significant interventional effect, suggesting a possible indirect or spurious link. Third, Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport has strong evidence supporting a direct relationship, which should be preserved. To refine the graph, we should consider deleting the edges from LungParench \u2192 Disease and CO2 \u2192 CO2Report, and confirm whether any new edges should be added based on the data. We will design targeted experiments to validate these changes.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: Marginal evidence suggests that do(LungParench) has no significant effect on Disease, indicating the relationship may be indirect or spurious. Removing this edge would simplify the model and align it with the observed lack of direct influence.)\n2. DELETE: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: Marginal evidence suggests no significant effect of do(CO2) on CO2Report, indicating the relationship may be indirect or spurious. This edge may not represent a direct causal relationship and should be removed.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a key factor in neonatal disease progression and could be a direct contributor to Disease. Adding this edge may improve the model's explanatory power and align with clinical understanding.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'LVH', 'LungFlow', 'Sick', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

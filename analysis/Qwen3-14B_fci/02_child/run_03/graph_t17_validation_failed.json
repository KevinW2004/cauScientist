Since previous attempts to add this edge have failed, it may be due to constraints in the model's current structure. To resolve this, we can consider reversing an existing edge that may be incorrectly directed, such as HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungFlow, which might be better represented as LungFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2, as improved lung flow could reduce hypoxia levels. This reversal would free up the model to accommodate the addition of LungParench \u2192 HypDistrib in a future iteration.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LungFlow -> LungParench\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 15):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  LungParench \u2192 HypDistrib\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -154929.42994306772\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -154942.4857, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LungFlow', 'HypoxiaInO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

This implies the edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report should be deleted.\n\n2. **LungParench \u2192 Disease**: The tentative note suggests no significant effect of do(LungParench) on Disease, which implies the direct edge may not exist. This suggests the edge LungParench \u2192 Disease should be deleted.\n\n3. **LVHreport \u2192 Disease**: While not directly mentioned in the tentative notes, the presence of LVH \u2192 Disease and the absence of LVHreport in the graph suggests that LVHreport, which likely represents a reported version of LVH, may have a direct influence on Disease. This relationship should be added to the graph to better capture the causal structure.\n\nFor each of these candidate operations, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to verify the causal influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests no significant effect of do(CO2) on CO2Report, indicating the relationship may be indirect or spurious.)\n2. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests no significant effect of do(LungParench) on Disease, implying the direct causal relationship may not exist.)\n3. ADD: LVHreport \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: LVHreport likely represents a clinical report of LVH, which could directly influence the diagnosis of Disease. Adding this edge would better represent the causal relationship between LVHreport and Disease.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['BirthAsphyxia', 'LVH', 'LungFlow', 'Sick', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

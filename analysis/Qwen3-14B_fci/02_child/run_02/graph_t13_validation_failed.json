Here are the identified candidate changes and the experiments to test them:\n\n1. **Add**: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2. Based on physiological understanding, hypoxia in oxygen (HypoxiaInO2) is likely to directly affect oxygen levels in the lower body (LowerBodyO2), especially in neonates with compromised circulation.\n\n2. **Add**: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report. CO2 levels are typically reported as part of clinical assessments, so the direct effect of CO2 on CO2Report is plausible and should be included.\n\n3. **Reverse**: Grunting \u2192 Sick. While the current graph shows Sick \u2192 Grunting, it is possible that grunting is a symptom that can lead to a diagnosis of sickness (Sick), or that grunting is a sign of being sick. Reversing this edge may better reflect the direction of influence based on clinical reasoning.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: Hypoxia in oxygen is expected to directly impact oxygen levels in the lower body, especially in neonates with poor circulation or cardiac mixing.)\n2. ADD: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: CO2 levels are directly reported in clinical settings, so the CO2 measurement should influence the CO2Report.)\n3. REVERSE: Sick \u2192 Grunting (Reasoning: Grunting is a clinical sign that may be used to infer sickness. Reversing the edge to reflect Grunting \u2192 Sick may better align with the diagnostic process.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HypDistrib\u2192Disease, CardiacMixing\u2192HypDistrib, XrayReport\u2192LVHreport, HypoxiaInO2\u2192LowerBodyO2; REVERSE: Grunting\u2192Sick, Grunting\u2192GruntingReport\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

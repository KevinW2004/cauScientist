However, HypoxiaInO2 is a known driver of CardiacMixing, and CardiacMixing could plausibly influence Disease through mechanisms like impaired oxygen delivery or systemic stress. This suggests that CardiacMixing may be a mediator between HypoxiaInO2 and Disease, or it may directly influence Disease. To better understand this, we should test for a direct effect of CardiacMixing on Disease, as well as consider whether HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease is mediated by CardiacMixing. Additionally, we should evaluate whether LungParench influences Disease, as CO2 \u2192 LungParench is present, and LungParench could be a mediator or a direct contributor to Disease. Lastly, we should consider whether GruntingReport directly influences Disease, as Grunting is already linked to Disease through Sick, and GruntingReport may capture a more direct clinical indicator.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: CardiacMixing may directly influence Disease by affecting systemic oxygenation or contributing to systemic stress, which could exacerbate disease outcomes. This is a plausible direct causal link that is not yet represented in the graph.)\n2. ADD: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: LungParench may directly influence Disease by reflecting impaired lung function, which is a known contributor to disease severity. Since CO2 affects LungParench, and LungParench may influence Disease directly, this link should be tested.)\n3. ADD: GruntingReport \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: GruntingReport may capture a more direct clinical indicator of disease severity, and it is not currently connected to Disease. If GruntingReport is a more reliable or direct measure of disease than Grunting itself, it may warrant a direct link to Disease.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LVH'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.0949).

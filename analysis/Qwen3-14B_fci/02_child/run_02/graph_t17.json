For example, 'HypDistrib' is a variable that likely represents the distribution of hypoxia, which could influence 'LowerBodyO2' and 'RUQO2', both of which are measures of oxygenation in different body regions. Similarly, 'DuctFlow' (flow through the ductus arteriosus) is a key hemodynamic variable that may influence 'CardiacMixing', which in turn may affect 'HypoxiaInO2'. Additionally, 'LungParench' (lung parenchyma condition) might directly affect 'LungFlow', which is already present but could be strengthened by adding a direct edge. These changes aim to refine the causal structure based on physiological pathways and improve the graph's accuracy.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: HypDistrib likely influences regional oxygenation, including LowerBodyO2. A direct causal relationship is plausible based on the physiological mechanism of hypoxia distribution affecting peripheral oxygenation.)\n2. ADD: DuctFlow \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: Ductal flow directly affects the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart, making this a likely direct causal influence.)\n3. ADD: LungParench \u2192 LungFlow (Reasoning: Lung parenchyma condition (e.g., consolidation or edema) directly impacts lung flow, which is a well-established physiological relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

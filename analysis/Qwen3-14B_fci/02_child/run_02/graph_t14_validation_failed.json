While previous attempts to directly add CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench failed, this may be due to confounding or indirect pathways. To refine the graph, we propose testing a reverse operation on the existing edge CO2 \u2192 LungParench, as CO2 levels may be a downstream effect of LungParench rather than a direct cause. This would allow us to explore whether LungParench influences CO2, which aligns with the physiological process of gas exchange and could improve the model's likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> CardiacMixing\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 10):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155187.8149361712\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -155415.9826, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LungParench', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 CO2 or CO2 \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 CO2 or CO2 \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

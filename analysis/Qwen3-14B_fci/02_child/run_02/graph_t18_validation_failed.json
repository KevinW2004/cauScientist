For instance, LungParench (lung parenchyma) is likely influenced by LungFlow, as reduced lung flow can lead to impaired lung parenchyma. Similarly, HypoxiaInO2 (hypoxia in oxygen) may directly influence LowerBodyO2, as oxygen distribution is affected by systemic hypoxia. Lastly, XrayReport is a report of ChestXray findings, so it is reasonable to suspect a direct causal link from ChestXray to XrayReport. These three relationships are candidates for addition, and targeted experiments can help validate their presence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LungFlow \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Reduced lung flow can lead to impaired gas exchange and lung parenchymal damage, suggesting a direct causal influence from LungFlow to LungParench.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: Systemic hypoxia (HypoxiaInO2) is likely to affect oxygen delivery to the lower body, making this a plausible direct causal relationship.)\n3. ADD: ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport (Reasoning: XrayReport is a direct interpretation of the ChestXray findings, so it is reasonable to expect a direct causal link from ChestXray to XrayReport.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

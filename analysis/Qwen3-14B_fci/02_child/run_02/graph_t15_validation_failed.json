First, the variable 'LVHreport' is currently only influenced by 'LVH', but it is plausible that 'Disease' or 'Sick' could also influence the reporting of LVH. Second, 'CardiacMixing' is influenced by 'HypoxiaInO2', but 'CardiacMixing' may also be influenced by 'LVH' or 'Disease' based on clinical knowledge. Third, 'HypDistrib' is not currently connected to any other node, but it is likely a downstream effect of 'CardiacMixing' or 'HypoxiaInO2'. Each of these changes can be tested through targeted interventions.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Disease \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: Clinical reports (like LVHreport) are often influenced by the presence of a disease. If a disease is diagnosed, it may affect the interpretation or likelihood of LVH being reported, even if LVH itself is unchanged.)\n2. ADD: LVH \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) can affect cardiac mixing, especially in neonates. It is plausible that LVH directly influences CardiacMixing, which is a key factor in oxygenation and gas exchange.)\n3. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib (Reasoning: HypDistrib (hypoxia distribution) is likely a downstream consequence of how well oxygen is mixed in the heart. CardiacMixing directly affects oxygen delivery and distribution, making it a plausible cause of HypDistrib.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

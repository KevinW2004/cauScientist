Here are three candidate changes that could refine the graph:\n\n1. **Add an edge from HypoxiaInO2 to LowerBodyO2**: Hypoxia in oxygen is likely to influence oxygen distribution, including lower body oxygenation, which is represented by HypDistrib \u2192 LowerBodyO2. However, HypoxiaInO2 may also directly affect LowerBodyO2, independent of HypDistrib.\n\n2. **Delete the edge from LungFlow \u2192 Disease**: While LungFlow may influence ChestXray, its direct effect on Disease is not well justified. Disease is a broader outcome and may be better explained by other variables like BirthAsphyxia, LVH, and Sick.\n\n3. **Add an edge from CO2 \u2192 CO2Report**: CO2 levels are likely measured and reported, so CO2 should directly influence CO2Report, rather than relying on indirect relationships.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: Hypoxia in oxygen is a direct physiological factor that can influence oxygen distribution to the lower body, independent of HypDistrib.)\n2. DELETE: LungFlow \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: LungFlow may influence ChestXray, but its direct effect on Disease is not well supported. Disease is more likely influenced by other variables such as BirthAsphyxia, LVH, and Sick.)\n3. ADD: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: CO2 levels are directly measured and reported, so CO2 should have a direct causal influence on CO2Report.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: LungFlow\u2192LungParench\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

This suggests that the current graph may be missing a direct edge from CardiacMixing to Disease, or that the relationship is mediated by other variables. To improve the graph, we consider adding a direct edge from CardiacMixing to Disease. Additionally, we note that HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing may be a candidate for further validation, as it is a key upstream node. Lastly, we suspect that LowerBodyO2 or RUQO2 might influence CardiacMixing or HypoxiaInO2, which are important for understanding Disease progression, and these relationships are currently unmodeled. We propose to investigate these three candidate changes.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: The tentative note highlights a lack of evidence for a direct causal link between CardiacMixing and Disease. Adding this edge would allow us to test whether CardiacMixing has a direct effect on Disease, independent of other mediators.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a key determinant of CardiacMixing. Although the current graph includes this edge, we suspect it may be under-validated. Adding this edge explicitly and testing its strength can improve the accuracy of the causal model.)\n3. ADD: LowerBodyO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: LowerBodyO2 is a measure of peripheral oxygenation, which may directly influence CardiacMixing. This relationship is not currently modeled and could be a critical mediator of Disease progression.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'LVH'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects Disease (avg_TVD=0.0949).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

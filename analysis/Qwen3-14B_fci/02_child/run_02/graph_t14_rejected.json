Based on domain knowledge and the structure of the graph, the following candidate changes are proposed:\n\n1. **HypDistrib \u2192 CardiacMixing**: In the current graph, CardiacMixing is influenced only by HypoxiaInO2. However, HypDistrib (which refers to the distribution of hypoxia) could directly affect CardiacMixing, especially in the context of pulmonary hypertension or shunting. This is a plausible addition to the graph.\n\n2. **LVHreport \u2192 Disease**: The current graph shows LVH \u2192 Disease and LVH \u2192 LVHreport, but not LVHreport \u2192 Disease. However, the report of LVH (LVHreport) is a clinical finding that may be used to diagnose or influence Disease, especially in the context of a diagnosis pathway. This suggests a direct influence from LVHreport to Disease.\n\n3. **LungParench \u2192 Disease**: In the current graph, CO2 \u2192 LungParench, and LungParench is a potential indicator of lung pathology. Since LungParench is a component of the lung's structural health, it may directly influence Disease status. This relationship is likely missing in the current graph and should be added.\n\nTo verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are proposed for each candidate operation.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: HypDistrib (hypoxia distribution) is a physiological factor that can directly affect cardiac mixing, especially in the presence of congenital heart defects or pulmonary hypertension. This is a plausible direct causal influence not currently represented in the graph.)\n2. ADD: LVHreport \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: The clinical report of LVH (LVHreport) is used in diagnosing Disease, suggesting that LVHreport is a downstream variable that influences Disease status. This relationship is not explicitly modeled in the current graph.)\n3. ADD: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: LungParench (lung parenchymal health) is a direct indicator of lung function and pathology. Its state can directly influence the overall Disease status, especially in the context of respiratory diseases. This relationship is missing in the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

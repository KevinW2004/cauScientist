While the current edge CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench is present, it may be too direct or oversimplified. A more nuanced approach could involve considering the role of HypDistrib, which may mediate the influence of CardiacMixing on LungParench by affecting how oxygen and nutrients are distributed to the lungs. Adding HypDistrib as an intermediary could improve the model's accuracy and likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> CardiacMixing\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 15):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -154868.67047082356\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -154917.1242, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypDistrib', 'LungParench')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

First, 'HypoxiaInO2' is currently only connected to 'CardiacMixing', but it is plausible that it also influences 'LowerBodyO2' and 'RUQO2', which are both oxygen saturation measures. Second, 'CO2' is connected to 'LungParench', but it may also influence 'CO2Report', which is a reported measure of CO2 levels. Third, 'Disease' is connected to multiple outcomes, but it may be influenced by 'CardiacMixing', which is a physiological process that could contribute to disease progression. These three changes\u2014adding two edges and reversing one\u2014could improve the causal accuracy of the graph. To verify these, targeted interventional experiments would be designed.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2 (Reasoning: Hypoxia in oxygen (HypoxiaInO2) is a direct cause of reduced oxygen saturation in the lower body (LowerBodyO2), as hypoxia affects systemic oxygen delivery.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 RUQO2 (Reasoning: Hypoxia in oxygen (HypoxiaInO2) is a direct cause of reduced oxygen saturation in the right upper quadrant (RUQO2), as hypoxia affects regional oxygenation.)\n3. ADD: CardiacMixing \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: Cardiac mixing (CardiacMixing) is a physiological abnormality that can contribute to disease progression, so it is likely a direct cause of Disease.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

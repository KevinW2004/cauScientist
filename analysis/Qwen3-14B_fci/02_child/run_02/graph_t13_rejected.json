However, LungParench \u2192 CO2 may be questionable, as CO2 levels are more directly influenced by LungFlow and CardiacMixing rather than LungParench. Reversing this edge to CO2 \u2192 LungParench would not be valid based on domain knowledge. Instead, we should consider adding a direct edge from HypoxiaInO2 to CardiacMixing, as hypoxia can affect cardiac function and mixing in congenital heart disease, which is a plausible and underexplored causal pathway.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> LungParench\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 12):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155304.37124803054\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

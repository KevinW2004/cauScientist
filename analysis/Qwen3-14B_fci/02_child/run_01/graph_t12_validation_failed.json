Based on the tentative notes, the relationships involving CO2 and CO2Report, as well as ChestXray and XrayReport, are questionable. Additionally, there may be a missing direct influence of HypoxiaInO2 on Disease, which could be a key driver in the causal pathway. These three relationships are prioritized for evaluation: (1) CO2 \u2192 CO2Report, (2) ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport, and (3) HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease. Each of these is either not directly supported by evidence or may be influenced by confounding factors, and their inclusion or exclusion could significantly refine the graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship between CO2 and CO2Report may be mediated by other factors or not direct. If CO2 does not directly influence CO2Report, removing this edge would better reflect the true causal structure.)\n2. DELETE: ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the relationship between ChestXray and XrayReport may be influenced by radiologist interpretation rather than a direct causal link. Removing this edge would better represent the indirect or mediated nature of this relationship.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a critical factor in neonatal disease progression. Adding a direct edge from HypoxiaInO2 to Disease would reflect its potential role as a cause of disease, independent of other variables like BirthAsphyxia or LungParench.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['CO2', 'LungFlow', 'HypoxiaInO2'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: LungParench\u2192Disease, HypoxiaInO2\u2192LungParench; DELETE: CO2\u2192CO2Report, CardiacMixing\u2192HypDistrib\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

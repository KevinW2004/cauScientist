However, the direct link from 'CardiacMixing' to 'Disease' has previously failed. Instead of adding that edge, we should explore whether 'CardiacMixing' influences other variables that are already connected to 'Disease', such as 'LungParench' or 'LungFlow'. This may provide a more plausible and valid pathway that aligns with domain knowledge and improves the model's log-likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 11):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155415.98255817912\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

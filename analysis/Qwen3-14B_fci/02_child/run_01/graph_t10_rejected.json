These are high-priority candidates for refinement. Additionally, the relationship between LungParench and Disease is not explicitly modeled, but given that LungParench is influenced by CO2 and CardiacMixing, and Disease is influenced by LungFlow, it is plausible that LungParench could also influence Disease. Therefore, we propose three candidate operations: adding LungParench \u2192 Disease, adding CO2 \u2192 CO2Report, and adding ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport. For each, we design an experiment to confirm the causal link.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: LungParench is influenced by CO2 and CardiacMixing, both of which are related to respiratory and circulatory function. Given that Disease is influenced by LungFlow and other factors, it is plausible that LungParench could also directly influence Disease.)\n2. ADD: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: Although the current graph lacks a direct link between CO2 and CO2Report, it is reasonable to suspect that CO2 levels may directly influence the CO2Report, potentially mediated by medical interpretation or measurement devices.)\n3. ADD: ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport (Reasoning: ChestXray is a direct input for generating XrayReport, and while radiologist interpretation may mediate the relationship, it is still a causal influence. Adding this link would better represent the process.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['CO2', 'LungFlow', 'HypoxiaInO2'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

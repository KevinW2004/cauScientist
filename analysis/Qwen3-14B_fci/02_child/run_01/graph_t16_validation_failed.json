First, the relationship between CO2 and CO2Report is not well-supported, as it may be mediated by other factors. Second, the relationship between ChestXray and XrayReport is similarly uncertain due to the influence of radiologist interpretation. Third, there is no explicit link between HypoxiaInO2 and Disease, which may be a missing causal pathway given the presence of other oxygen-related variables like LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2. These three areas are prioritized for refinement.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the direct causal link between CO2 and CO2Report is not well-supported and may be mediated by other factors. Removing this edge would allow us to test whether the relationship is truly direct or influenced by other variables.)\n2. DELETE: ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the direct causal link between ChestXray and XrayReport is uncertain due to the role of radiologist interpretation. Removing this edge will allow us to test whether the relationship is direct or influenced by external factors.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a critical oxygen-related variable, and given the presence of other oxygen-related variables (e.g., LowerBodyO2, RUQO2) that are linked to Disease, it is plausible that HypoxiaInO2 directly influences Disease. Adding this edge would better represent the causal pathway from hypoxia to disease progression.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['CO2', 'LungFlow', 'HypoxiaInO2'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

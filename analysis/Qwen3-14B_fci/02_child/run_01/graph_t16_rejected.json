While the direct edge from 'CardiacMixing' to 'Disease' previously failed, it is plausible that 'CardiacMixing' influences 'HypDistrib', which in turn affects 'Disease'. This aligns with the physiological mechanism where impaired cardiac mixing leads to abnormal oxygen distribution, contributing to disease progression. Adding this edge may provide a more accurate and valid causal pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155096.84762957465\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -157866.6447, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypDistrib', 'Disease')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge HypDistrib \u2192 Disease not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

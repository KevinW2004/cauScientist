Based on domain knowledge and logical inference, the following candidate changes are proposed:\n\n1. **Add**: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2. This is based on the physiological understanding that hypoxia (low oxygen) can lead to increased CO2 retention due to impaired gas exchange and respiratory compensation.\n\n2. **Add**: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench. Hypoxia is a known contributor to lung parenchymal changes, such as edema or inflammation, so this relationship is plausible.\n\n3. **Reverse**: Grunting \u2192 Sick. The current graph has Sick \u2192 Grunting, which implies that sickness causes grunting. However, grunting is a clinical sign that may indicate sickness, so it is more likely that grunting is a symptom of being sick, not the cause. Reversing this edge may better reflect the true causal direction.\n\nTo verify these changes, the following experiments are proposed:\n\n- For the added edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2, an interventional experiment can be designed to manipulate HypoxiaInO2 and observe its effect on CO2 levels.\n- For the added edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench, a similar interventional approach can be used to assess whether altering HypoxiaInO2 leads to changes in LungParench.\n- For the reversed edge Grunting \u2192 Sick, an experiment would test whether inducing grunting leads to changes in the Sick variable, which would contradict the current causal direction and support the reversal.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2 (Reasoning: Hypoxia can lead to CO2 retention due to impaired gas exchange and compensatory mechanisms in the respiratory system.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Hypoxia is a known contributor to lung parenchymal changes, such as edema or inflammation, which can be observed in LungParench.)\n3. REVERSE: Sick \u2192 Grunting (Reasoning: Grunting is a clinical sign that may indicate sickness, suggesting that being sick causes grunting, rather than the other way around.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Disease', 'Age'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects LVH (avg_TVD=0.0122).

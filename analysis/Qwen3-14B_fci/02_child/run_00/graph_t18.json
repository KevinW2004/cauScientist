These factors are likely to directly impact 'LungParench' (lung parenchyma), which represents lung tissue health. Although previous attempts to add direct edges from 'CardiacMixing' and 'HypDistrib' to 'LungParench' have failed, it is plausible that these relationships are not fully captured in the current graph. To address this, I propose reversing the existing edge from 'CO2' to 'LungParench' to better align with the causal mechanism where lung parenchyma health may influence CO2 levels, rather than the other way around. This reversal may allow the graph to accommodate the addition of the previously failed edges in future iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -156950.01858549437\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -157178.2148, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LungParench', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -156998.4532, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypDistrib', 'LungParench')]\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 CO2 or CO2 \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 CO2 or CO2 \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 CO2 or CO2 \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 CO2 or CO2 \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Based on the tentative note that 'ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport' is likely indirect and mediated by 'XrayReport' or 'LVH', we should explore whether this edge should be removed or replaced with a more direct path. Additionally, we suspect that 'XrayReport' might directly influence 'LVHreport', and 'LVH' might influence 'XrayReport', which could explain the indirect path. We also consider that 'CO2Report' may be influenced by 'CO2' and possibly 'LungFlow', which is not currently captured in the graph. Finally, we suspect that 'HypoxiaInO2' may directly influence 'CardiacMixing', which is not currently represented in the graph and may be important for understanding disease progression.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  - Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from 'ChestXray' to 'LVHreport' is indirect and likely mediated by 'XrayReport' or 'LVH'. This edge may not represent a direct causal influence and should be removed to refine the graph.)\n2. ADD: XrayReport \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: If 'ChestXray' influences 'LVHreport' indirectly, it is plausible that 'XrayReport' serves as a mediator. Adding this edge would better reflect the causal mechanism.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: Hypoxia is a known contributor to cardiac mixing anomalies, and this relationship is not currently represented in the graph. Including this edge would better align the graph with physiological knowledge.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

This implies a potential DELETE operation on that edge. Additionally, we suspect that XrayReport may directly influence LVHreport, and that LVH may influence XrayReport. These two relationships (XrayReport \u2192 LVHreport and LVH \u2192 XrayReport) are plausible based on the clinical understanding that chest X-rays can be interpreted to detect LVH, and LVH itself can influence the interpretation of the X-ray report. Lastly, we suspect that LungParench may influence Disease, as LungParench is a pulmonary finding that could contribute to disease progression or diagnosis.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  - Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from ChestXray to LVHreport is indirect and mediated by other variables, such as XrayReport or LVH. This implies that the direct edge from ChestXray to LVHreport may not exist and should be deleted.)\n2. ADD: XrayReport \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: XrayReport is a clinical interpretation of the ChestXray, and it is reasonable to suspect that the report directly influences the LVHreport, which is likely a clinical judgment based on the report.)\n3. ADD: LVH \u2192 XrayReport (Reasoning: LVH is a cardiac condition that may be visually detectable on a chest X-ray, and thus may influence the interpretation of the X-ray report. This suggests a direct causal relationship from LVH to XrayReport.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

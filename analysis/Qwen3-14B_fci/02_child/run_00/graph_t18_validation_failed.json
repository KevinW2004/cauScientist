Additionally, there may be missing direct relationships between variables that are currently only connected through intermediaries. For example, 'XrayReport' may directly influence 'LVHreport', and 'HypoxiaInO2' may directly influence 'CO2' or 'LungParench'. I also suspect that 'CO2Report' may be directly influenced by 'CO2', which is not currently represented in the graph. These changes aim to make the graph more accurate and reflective of direct causal influences.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  - Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from 'ChestXray' to 'LVHreport' is indirect and mediated by other variables such as 'XrayReport' or 'LVH'. This implies that the direct edge should be removed to better represent the true causal pathway.)\n2. ADD: XrayReport \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: If 'XrayReport' is a mediator between 'ChestXray' and 'LVHreport', then it is plausible that 'XrayReport' directly influences 'LVHreport'. This addition would align the graph with the tentative note and provide a clearer causal pathway.)\n3. ADD: CO2 \u2192 CO2Report (Reasoning: It is reasonable to expect that 'CO2' directly influences 'CO2Report', as the latter is likely a reported value of the former. This direct relationship may currently be missing in the graph and should be added.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR.

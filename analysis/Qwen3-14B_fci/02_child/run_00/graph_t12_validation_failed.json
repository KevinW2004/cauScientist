First, I suspect that the link from ChestXray to LVHreport is not direct but instead mediated by XrayReport or LVH. Second, I believe that HypoxiaInO2 may directly influence CardiacMixing, which is currently not represented. Third, I suspect that CO2Report may directly influence Disease, which is not currently modeled. These changes are motivated by the need to clarify indirect pathways and account for unmodeled direct influences.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  - Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship between ChestXray and LVHreport is indirect and likely mediated by XrayReport or LVH. Removing this direct link would better reflect the actual causal structure.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CardiacMixing (Reasoning: Hypoxia is a known contributor to cardiac mixing issues, and the current graph does not capture this potential direct influence. Adding this edge would align with clinical knowledge about hypoxia's effects on cardiac function.)\n3. ADD: CO2Report \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: CO2Report is a clinical measurement that may directly influence the diagnosis of Disease. Including this edge would better capture the role of CO2 levels in disease progression or diagnosis.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['Disease', 'Age'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: XrayReport\u2192LVHreport, HypoxiaInO2\u2192CardiacMixing; DELETE: ChestXray\u2192LVHreport, ChestXray\u2192LVHreport, ChestXray\u2192LVHreport, ChestXray\u2192LVHreport, ChestXray\u2192LVHreport\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

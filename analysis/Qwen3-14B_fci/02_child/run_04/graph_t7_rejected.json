Grunting is more likely a symptom of being Sick rather than a cause of it. However, reversing this edge has previously failed. Instead, we should explore adding a direct edge from Disease \u2192 Grunting, as Disease may be a more upstream cause of Grunting, and this could better reflect the causal mechanism. This would also help clarify the relationship between the underlying disease and clinical signs like Grunting.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155098.29264654423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

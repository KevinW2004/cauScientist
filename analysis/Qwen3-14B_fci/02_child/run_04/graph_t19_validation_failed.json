The first priority is addressing the notes about spurious or indirect relationships. Specifically, the note that 'ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport' was previously tested and found to be spurious suggests that this edge should be removed. Additionally, the note that 'HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench' has no significant effect in interventional evidence implies that this relationship may be indirect or spurious and should be removed or reversed. Finally, there is a potential missing causal link between 'HypoxiaInO2' and 'DuctFlow', which is currently present in the graph, but we suspect it may be indirect due to the influence of other variables like 'CO2' or 'LungFlow'. We propose three candidate operations to refine the graph accordingly.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: ChestXray \u2192 LVHreport (Reasoning: This relationship was previously tested and found to be indirect or spurious, suggesting that ChestXray does not directly cause LVHreport.)\n2. DELETE: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Interventional evidence suggests no significant effect, indicating this relationship may be spurious or indirect.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 DuctFlow (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a known driver of ductal patency and may directly influence DuctFlow, which is currently only influenced by HypoxiaInO2 in the graph. This addition could improve the model's accuracy.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'Disease'], do(LVH) affects LVHreport (avg_TVD=0.2565).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

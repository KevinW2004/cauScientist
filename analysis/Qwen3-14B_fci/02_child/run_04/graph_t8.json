Grunting is a clinical sign that may be more directly influenced by factors like LungParench or HypoxiaInO2, rather than being a downstream effect of 'Sick'. Reversing the edge from 'Sick' to 'Grunting' may not be valid due to prior failures, so instead, I propose adding a direct causal link from 'LungParench' to 'Grunting' based on domain knowledge that impaired lung function can lead to grunting in neonates with congenital heart disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155940.51441151387\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge LungParench \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

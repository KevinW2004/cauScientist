The previous failed attempts to add the edge LungParench \u2192 Grunting suggest that the system may have constraints on direct additions. However, since the edge LungParench \u2192 Grunting is already present in the current graph, the failure might be due to a different reason (e.g., validation rules or model constraints). To ensure the graph better reflects the causal mechanism, I will confirm the existing edge LungParench \u2192 Grunting as a valid and direct causal relationship.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LungParench -> Grunting\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 8):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155940.51441151387\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

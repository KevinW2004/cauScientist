First, the relationship between HypoxiaInO2 and LungParench was previously found to be indirect or spurious, suggesting it should be removed. Second, there is no direct link from HypoxiaInO2 to Disease, but given that HypoxiaInO2 influences DuctFlow, and DuctFlow may influence Disease indirectly, we should explore a direct link from HypoxiaInO2 to Disease. Finally, the current graph lacks a direct link from LungParench to Disease, which seems plausible given that lung parenchymal issues could contribute to disease severity.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LungParench (Reasoning: Previous interventional evidence suggested that HypoxiaInO2 does not directly influence LungParench, indicating that the relationship is likely indirect or spurious.)\n2. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 may directly contribute to disease progression, possibly through mechanisms like impaired oxygenation or increased metabolic demand, which should be tested.)\n3. ADD: LungParench \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: Lung parenchymal abnormalities are likely to have a direct impact on disease severity, and this connection is not currently represented in the graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'Disease'], do(LVH) affects LVHreport (avg_TVD=0.2565).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

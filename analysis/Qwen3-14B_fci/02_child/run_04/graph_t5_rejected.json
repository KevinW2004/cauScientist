This suggests that the current graph might incorrectly assume a direct causal relationship from LungParench to HypDistrib. To refine the graph, we should consider deleting this edge. Additionally, we should explore potential causal links from HypDistrib to Disease, as HypDistrib is a known clinical indicator of perfusion and could influence disease outcomes. Lastly, we should examine whether HypoxiaInO2 directly influences Disease, as HypoxiaInO2 is a critical factor in neonatal health and might have a direct effect on disease progression.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - BirthAsphyxia \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  - DuctFlow \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  - CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  - LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  - CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  - LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  - ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  - Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  - Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LungParench \u2192 HypDistrib (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the relationship from LungParench to HypDistrib lacks sufficient evidence and may be spurious. Removing this edge will help refine the graph by eliminating unsupported causal assumptions.)\n2. ADD: HypDistrib \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypDistrib is a clinical measure of perfusion and may directly influence disease progression. Adding this edge would better represent the potential causal pathway from perfusion status to disease outcomes.)\n3. ADD: HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease (Reasoning: HypoxiaInO2 is a critical factor in neonatal outcomes and may directly contribute to disease progression. Including this direct edge would provide a more accurate representation of its role in the causal model.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Age', 'CO2'], do(BirthAsphyxia) affects HypoxiaInO2 (avg_TVD=0.1059).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: LungParench\u2192HypDistrib\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

However, the FCI algorithm hints suggest that there may be a reverse causal relationship or confounding between 'bronc' and 'smoke'. To test this, we can reverse the edge 'smoke \u2192 bronc' to 'bronc \u2192 smoke' to explore if bronchitis influences smoking behavior (e.g., due to increased awareness or compensatory behavior).

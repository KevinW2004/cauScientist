However, previous attempts to reverse this edge have failed due to invalid operations. Instead of reversing, we should consider removing the edge 'bronc \u2192 smoke' and re-evaluating whether any other edges or relationships could better explain the data while maintaining a valid DAG. This removal would align the graph with domain knowledge and allow for more accurate modeling of the causal structure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - asia -> tub\n  - smoke -> lung\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - tub -> xray\n  - lung -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  tub \u2192 xray\n  lung \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -25275.580943097844\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge bronc \u2192 smoke not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

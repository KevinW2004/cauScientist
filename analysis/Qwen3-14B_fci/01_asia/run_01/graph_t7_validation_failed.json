However, based on domain knowledge, smoking is a known risk factor for bronchitis, and the FCI algorithm's suggestion that 'bronc' is not caused by 'smoke' may be due to confounding or reverse causation in observational data. Therefore, it is worth re-evaluating this edge. However, since the previous attempts to delete or reverse it failed, a more strategic local refinement might be to add a new edge that better captures the diagnostic relationship between 'xray' and 'either', as 'xray' is a diagnostic tool that can detect both 'tub' and 'lung', which are the causes of 'either'.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

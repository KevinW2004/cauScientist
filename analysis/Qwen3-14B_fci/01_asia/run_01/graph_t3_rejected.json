This is implausible based on domain knowledge, as smoking is a known cause of bronchitis, not the other way around. Reversing this edge would better align with the causal mechanism where smoking contributes to bronchitis. This change is likely to improve the log-likelihood by correcting a reversed causal relationship.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - tub \u2192 either\n  - bronc \u2192 dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -27275.29780201598\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge smoke \u2192 bronc not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

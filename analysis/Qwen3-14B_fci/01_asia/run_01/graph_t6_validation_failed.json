Based on the tentative notes, the edge 'bronc \u2192 smoke' is suspected to be either indirect or fully mediated, suggesting that the direction may be reversed. Additionally, the variables 'asia', 'tub', 'lung', 'either', 'xray', and 'dysp' are not fully connected, which may affect the accuracy of causal inferences. The following candidate operations are proposed to refine the graph: (1) reverse the edge from 'bronc \u2192 smoke' to 'smoke \u2192 bronc' to align with domain knowledge, (2) add the edge 'lung \u2192 either' to reflect the fact that lung cancer can cause the symptom 'either', and (3) add the edge 'tub \u2192 xray' to capture the causal influence of tuberculosis on x-ray results. These changes will be tested through targeted interventional experiments to confirm their validity.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: Based on domain knowledge, smoking is a known cause of bronchitis, not the other way around. The current edge 'bronc \u2192 smoke' is likely an artifact of correlation or reverse causality and should be reversed to reflect the true causal direction.)\n2. ADD: lung \u2192 either (Reasoning: Lung cancer (lung) is a known cause of the symptom 'either', which represents the presence of either lung cancer or tuberculosis. This relationship is essential to accurately model the causal structure of the asia domain.)\n3. ADD: tub \u2192 xray (Reasoning: Tuberculosis (tub) is a known cause of abnormal x-ray results. Adding this edge will help capture the direct causal influence of tuberculosis on x-ray outcomes, which is important for diagnostic reasoning.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'lung'], do(smoke) affects bronc (avg_TVD=0.0150).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: tub\u2192either, smoke\u2192lung; REVERSE: smoke\u2192bronc, bronc\u2192smoke\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

However, there are a few relationships that may be worth re-evaluating to ensure the graph accurately reflects the underlying causal mechanisms. Based on domain knowledge and standard causal assumptions, the following candidate changes are proposed for refinement:\n\n1. The relationship 'smoke \u2192 bronc' is included in the current graph, but bronchitis (bronc) is often considered a symptom of other conditions (e.g., tuberculosis or lung disease) rather than a direct effect of smoking. This suggests that the edge 'smoke \u2192 bronc' may be spurious or indirect, and could be removed or reversed.\n\n2. The variable 'either' is defined as the logical disjunction of 'tub' and 'lung'. In the current graph, it is treated as a latent variable influenced by both. However, 'either' may not have a direct causal influence on 'dysp' but rather acts as a mediator. This suggests that the edge 'either \u2192 dysp' may not be a direct causal link and could be removed.\n\n3. There is no explicit edge from 'tub' to 'dysp' in the current graph, but tuberculosis can lead to dyspnea through various pathways (e.g., via 'either' or 'xray'). Adding an edge from 'tub' to 'dysp' may better capture this potential direct influence.\n\nFor each of these candidate operations, a targeted interventional experiment is proposed to test the presence or absence of the causal relationship.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: Bronchitis (bronc) is more commonly associated with other conditions (e.g., tuberculosis or lung disease) rather than being a direct effect of smoking. Removing this edge would better align the graph with known causal pathways in the domain.)\n2. DELETE: either \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: While 'either' is a logical disjunction of 'tub' and 'lung', it may not have a direct causal effect on dyspnea (dysp). This edge may be an artifact of the logical structure rather than a direct causal mechanism.)\n3. ADD: tub \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: Tuberculosis can directly lead to dyspnea through physiological effects on the lungs. Adding this edge may provide a more accurate representation of the causal relationships in the domain.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'bronc'], do(smoke) affects lung (avg_TVD=0.0077).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: bronc\u2192either; DELETE: bronc\u2192dysp, either\u2192dysp; REVERSE: either\u2192dysp\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

However, based on the domain context of tuberculosis diagnosis, it is plausible that 'tub' may directly influence 'dysp' through a more specific respiratory mechanism. While the current edge is already present, there is potential to refine the graph by adding a direct edge from 'lung' to 'dysp', as lung disease (e.g., lung cancer) is also a known cause of dyspnea. This addition would better capture the causal pathways associated with dyspnea in the asia domain.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - tub -> either\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - smoke -> bronc\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  tub \u2192 dysp\n  lung \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -26846.53350282097\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

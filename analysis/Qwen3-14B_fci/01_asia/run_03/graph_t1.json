      "system_prompt": "You are an expert in causal inference and asia domain knowledge.\nYour task is to generate or refine causal graph hypotheses representing causal relationships.\nAlways ensure the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with no cycles.\n",
      "user_prompt": "Perform LOCAL amendments to the causal graph for the asia domain.\n\nVariables:\n- asia\n- tub\n- smoke\n- lung\n- bronc\n- either\n- xray\n- dysp\n\n\nDomain Context:\nTuberculosis diagnosis.\n\n\n\ud83e\udde0 YOUR EXPERIMENTAL INTENT & REASONING:\nThe current causal graph for the asia domain is incomplete and contains potential errors. Based on domain knowledge and standard causal relationships in the asia domain, the following candidate changes are proposed:\n\n1. **'smoke \u2192 lung'** is a well-established causal relationship in the asia domain. Smoking is a known cause of lung cancer, and this relationship should be explicitly included in the graph. The current graph lacks this edge, which is likely an omission.\n\n2. **'bronc \u2192 smoke'** is unlikely to be a direct causal relationship. It is more plausible that smoking causes bronchitis, rather than the reverse. This edge may be reversed or removed to better reflect the true causal direction.\n\n3. **'lung \u2192 either'** is a missing relationship. The variable 'either' represents the disjunction of 'lung' or 'tuberculosis', so 'lung' should directly influence 'either'. This edge is necessary to ensure the logical structure of the graph aligns with the semantics of 'either'.\n\nFor each of these candidate operations, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to verify the presence or absence of the causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: smoke \u2192 lung (Reasoning: Smoking is a known cause of lung disease, and 'lung' is a diagnostic variable indicating lung cancer. The absence of this edge suggests a missing causal link that should be included to reflect real-world medical knowledge.)\n2. REVERSE: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: The current edge 'bronc \u2192 smoke' implies that bronchitis causes smoking, which is implausible. The more reasonable direction is that smoking causes bronchitis, so reversing this edge would better align with domain knowledge.)\n3. ADD: lung \u2192 either (Reasoning: 'either' is defined as the disjunction of 'lung' or 'tub'. Therefore, 'lung' should directly influence 'either', which is currently missing in the graph. Adding this edge will ensure the logical structure of the graph reflects the semantics of 'either'.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['tub', 'bronc', 'asia']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects lung (TVD=0.0055). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'lung', 'asia'], do(bronc) affects smoke (avg_TVD=0.0524). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'bronc', 'xray', 'dysp'], do(lung) affects either (avg_TVD=0.2407). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  bronc \u2192 smoke\n  tub \u2192 either\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -27392.497222944934\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

This indicates that bronc may not be a direct effect of smoke, or that the direction of causality may be reversed. Additionally, the current graph lacks several potentially important relationships, such as between 'smoke' and 'lung', 'tub' and 'xray', and 'either' and 'xray'. These variables are commonly associated in the asia domain, and their inclusion would better reflect known causal dependencies. To verify these changes, targeted interventional experiments are needed.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: The previous note suggests that the edge 'smoke \u2192 bronc' may be spurious or reversed. If the effect of do(smoke) on bronc is not significant, the edge should be deleted.)\n2. ADD: smoke \u2192 lung (Reasoning: In the asia domain, smoking is a known risk factor for lung disease. Including this edge would better reflect the causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer.)\n3. ADD: either \u2192 xray (Reasoning: In the asia domain, 'either' (which represents either tuberculosis or lung cancer) is often a cause of abnormal x-ray findings. Adding this edge would align with known causal structures.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['tub', 'bronc', 'asia']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects lung (TVD=0.0055). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'lung', 'asia'], do(bronc) affects smoke (avg_TVD=0.0524). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'bronc', 'xray', 'dysp'], do(lung) affects either (avg_TVD=0.2407). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(bronc) affects smoke (TVD=0.0162). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects lung (TVD=0.0055). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(lung) affects either (TVD=0.4064). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['tub', 'lung'], do(bronc) affects smoke (avg_TVD=0.0318).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: smoke\u2192bronc; REVERSE: smoke\u2192bronc\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

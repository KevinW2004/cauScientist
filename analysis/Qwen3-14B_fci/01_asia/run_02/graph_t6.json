Smoking is a known cause of bronchitis, so the direction should be 'smoke \u2192 bronc' to reflect the causal mechanism. However, this edge has been previously attempted and failed to improve the log-likelihood. Given the constraints, I propose exploring an additional edge that aligns with the confirmed relationships and domain knowledge, such as 'lung \u2192 either', since lung cancer, like tuberculosis, can lead to the 'either' condition (presence of a lung disease). This addition may better capture the causal structure and improve the likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - tub -> either\n  - bronc -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -24582.378403456183\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

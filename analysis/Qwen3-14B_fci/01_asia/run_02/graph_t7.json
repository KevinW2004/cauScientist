However, the log-likelihood is not optimal, suggesting there may be additional causal relationships that are not yet captured. Based on domain knowledge, 'lung \u2192 either' is already included, but 'asia \u2192 tub' is a plausible and underrepresented edge in the current graph. The 'asia' variable represents the presence of tuberculosis, which is a direct cause of 'tub'.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

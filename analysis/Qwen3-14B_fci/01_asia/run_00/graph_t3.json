Smoking is a known risk factor for bronchitis, suggesting a more plausible causal direction from 'smoke \u2192 bronc'. Reversing this edge would better align with the causal mechanism of smoking contributing to bronchitis.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

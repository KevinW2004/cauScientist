This may imply the edge is either reversed or spurious. Additionally, the graph lacks potential edges that could explain the causal relationships between variables like 'asia' and 'tub', or 'smoke' and 'lung'. These are plausible candidates for addition. Finally, the edge bronc \u2192 dysp may be missing a direct effect from 'lung' to 'dysp', which is not currently represented. These three relationships are prioritized for testing.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: bronc \u2192 smoke (Reasoning: The tentative note indicates that the edge bronc \u2192 smoke may be spurious or reversed, as there is no significant effect of do(smoke) on bronc. Removing this edge would align the graph with observed marginal evidence.)\n2. ADD: asia \u2192 tub (Reasoning: In the asia domain, 'asia' is a known risk factor for 'tuberculosis'. Including this edge would better reflect the causal relationship between geographic origin and disease risk.)\n3. ADD: lung \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: Lung disease can directly cause dyspnea (shortness of breath), so adding this edge would better capture the physiological pathway from lung disease to respiratory symptoms.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['asia', 'tub', 'bronc']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects lung (TVD=0.0055). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['asia', 'tub', 'lung']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects bronc (TVD=0.0190). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['tub', 'smoke', 'bronc']. FALLBACK to Marginal: RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(lung) affects either (TVD=0.4064). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects bronc (TVD=0.0190). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(asia) affects tub (TVD=0.0270). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['bronc', 'xray'], do(lung) affects dysp (avg_TVD=0.1127). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  bronc \u2192 smoke\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -24699.57782438514\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Analyze Candidates & Evidence**: Carefully evaluate each operation in the \ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list using the \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE and your \ud83e\udde0 EXPERIMENTAL INTENT.\n2. **Decision Rule (STRICT EVIDENCE-FIRST POLICY)**: \n   - You must treat \ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE as the Ground Truth. If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

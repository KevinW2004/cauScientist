This may indicate that the direction of the edge is reversed, or that the edge itself is spurious. To improve the graph, we should consider reversing this edge, deleting it, or adding a new edge based on conditional testing. Additionally, we should examine the directionality of the 'tub \u2192 either' and 'lung \u2192 either' edges, as 'either' is a logical disjunction of 'tub' and 'lung', which might imply a different structure. We will propose three candidate operations based on these considerations.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: smoke \u2192 bronc (Reasoning: The current edge 'bronc \u2192 smoke' may be reversed or spurious. If we reverse the edge to 'smoke \u2192 bronc', it would align with the hypothesis that smoking could cause bronchitis, which is a more plausible causal direction.)\n2. DELETE: bronc \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: While 'bronc \u2192 dysp' is present, we should verify whether bronchitis directly causes dyspnea or if this relationship is mediated by other variables. If no direct effect is found, the edge may be spurious.)\n3. ADD: either \u2192 xray (Reasoning: The variable 'either' represents the presence of either tuberculosis or lung cancer, which are both conditions that can be detected via x-ray. It is plausible that 'either' directly influences 'xray', and this relationship may be missing from the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- INSUFFICIENT DATA to condition on ['asia', 'tub', 'bronc'].

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: bronc\u2192smoke, bronc\u2192smoke, bronc\u2192smoke, bronc\u2192smoke; REVERSE: bronc\u2192smoke\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

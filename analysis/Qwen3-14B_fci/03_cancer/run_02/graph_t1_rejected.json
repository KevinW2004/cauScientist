      "system_prompt": "You are an expert in causal inference and cancer domain knowledge.\nYour task is to generate or refine causal graph hypotheses representing causal relationships.\nAlways ensure the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with no cycles.\n",

However, there are several potential missing or questionable relationships that could be refined based on domain knowledge and causal reasoning:\n\n1. **Smoker \u2192 Xray**: Smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer, which may lead to the need for X-ray imaging. Thus, a direct causal link from Smoker to Xray is plausible and may be missing in the current graph.\n\n2. **Pollution \u2192 Smoker**: There could be an indirect relationship where environmental pollution influences smoking behavior, such as through stress, socioeconomic factors, or availability of alternatives. This is a speculative but reasonable addition to explore.\n\n3. **Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea**: While the current graph shows Cancer \u2192 Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea, Dyspnoea (shortness of breath) is a direct symptom of cancer (e.g., lung cancer), so a direct link from Cancer to Dyspnoea may be more accurate than the indirect path through Xray.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, targeted interventional experiments can be designed to assess whether these relationships are direct and causal.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: Smoker \u2192 Xray (Reasoning: Smoking can lead to lung cancer and may directly increase the likelihood of undergoing an X-ray, independent of cancer status. This direct causal link should be considered.)\n2. ADD: Pollution \u2192 Smoker (Reasoning: Environmental pollution may indirectly influence smoking behavior through various social, psychological, or economic factors. This relationship could be a confounder or mediator in the causal chain.)\n3. REVERSE: Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea (Reasoning: Dyspnoea is a direct symptom of cancer and not solely a result of Xray findings. Thus, the direction from Xray to Dyspnoea may be incorrect and should be reversed to Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Pollution'], do(Smoker) affects Cancer (avg_TVD=0.0023). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Smoker'], do(Pollution) affects Cancer (avg_TVD=0.0106). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Dyspnoea'], do(Cancer) affects Xray (avg_TVD=0.3145).

Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(Pollution) affects Smoker (TVD=0.0060). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Xray'], do(Cancer) affects Dyspnoea (avg_TVD=0.1621).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

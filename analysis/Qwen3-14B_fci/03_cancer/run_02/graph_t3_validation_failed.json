While Xray can lead to Dyspnoea through procedural discomfort or anxiety, this is a weaker and less direct causal relationship compared to other edges. Given the focus on direct and strong causal relationships in the cancer domain, this edge is uncertain and may be contributing to a lower log-likelihood. We propose to remove this edge to refine the graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  - Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  - Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  - Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  - Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  - Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17880.520620237465\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

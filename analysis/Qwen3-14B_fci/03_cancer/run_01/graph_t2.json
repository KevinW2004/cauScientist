Based on the tentative notes, the relationships Cancer \u2192 Xray and Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea are supported by experimental evidence and cannot be deleted. However, some of the other edges may be over-specified or indirect. For example, the edges Pollution \u2192 Xray and Smoker \u2192 Xray may be mediated by Cancer, or the effect of Pollution and Smoker on Xray and Dyspnoea may be confounded by other variables. Additionally, there may be missing direct causal relationships, such as between Xray and Dyspnoea, which could be a confounder in the current setup. We propose three candidate operations to refine the graph: (1) delete the edge Pollution \u2192 Xray, (2) delete the edge Smoker \u2192 Xray, and (3) add the edge Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea. These operations are prioritized based on the need to reduce over-specification and to ensure all direct causal relationships are explicitly modeled.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: Pollution \u2192 Xray (Reasoning: The edge Pollution \u2192 Xray may be an indirect effect mediated by Cancer. If Cancer is a mediator, then the direct effect of Pollution on Xray may not exist once Cancer is accounted for.)\n2. DELETE: Smoker \u2192 Xray (Reasoning: Similar to the Pollution \u2192 Xray edge, the Smoker \u2192 Xray edge may be mediated by Cancer. If Cancer is a mediator, the direct effect of Smoker on Xray may be spurious.)\n3. ADD: Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea (Reasoning: Xray may directly influence Dyspnoea, for example, if a positive Xray result leads to increased awareness or treatment that affects breathing symptoms. This direct effect may be missing in the current graph.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(Pollution) affects Smoker (TVD=0.0060). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Smoker', 'Pollution'], do(Cancer) affects Xray (avg_TVD=0.2882). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Smoker', 'Pollution', 'Xray'], do(Cancer) affects Dyspnoea (avg_TVD=0.1729). Link is likely DIRECT / not fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Cancer'], do(Pollution) affects Xray (avg_TVD=0.0524). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['Cancer'], do(Smoker) affects Xray (avg_TVD=0.1364).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

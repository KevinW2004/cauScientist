      "user_prompt": "Perform LOCAL amendments to the causal graph for the asia domain.\n\nVariables:\n- asia\n- tub\n- smoke\n- lung\n- bronc\n- either\n- xray\n- dysp\n\n\nDomain Context:\nTuberculosis diagnosis.\n\n\n\ud83e\udde0 YOUR EXPERIMENTAL INTENT & REASONING:\nThe current causal graph captures some relationships in the asia domain, but there are potential missing or incomplete connections. Based on domain knowledge and the structure of the variables, we can hypothesize the following candidate changes:\n\n1. **Add 'smoke' \u2192 'tub'**: Smoking is a known risk factor for tuberculosis (tub). While the current graph shows 'asia' \u2192 'tub', it's possible that 'smoke' also has a direct influence on 'tub', especially in non-Asian populations.\n\n2. **Add 'smoke' \u2192 'lung'**: Smoking is a direct cause of lung cancer. The current graph does not show this relationship, which is crucial for modeling the causal pathways of lung-related conditions.\n\n3. **Add 'either' \u2192 'dysp'**: Dyspnea (dysp) is a common symptom of either tuberculosis or lung cancer. While 'bronc' \u2192 'dysp' is already present, the variable 'either' likely also contributes to dyspnea directly.\n\nTo verify these relationships, we can perform targeted interventional experiments by manipulating the suspected parent and observing the effect on the child variable, while controlling for relevant confounders.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: smoke \u2192 tub (Reasoning: Smoking is a known risk factor for tuberculosis. Adding this edge would better reflect the causal mechanism behind tub in both Asian and non-Asian populations.)\n2. ADD: smoke \u2192 lung (Reasoning: Smoking is a direct cause of lung cancer. This relationship is missing in the current graph and is essential for accurately modeling the causal structure.)\n3. ADD: either \u2192 dysp (Reasoning: Dyspnea is a common symptom of either tuberculosis or lung cancer. Including this edge would better capture the causal pathway from disease presence to symptoms.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects lung (TVD=0.0055). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects bronc (TVD=0.0190). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(tub) affects either (TVD=0.4324). This SUPPORTS ANCESTRAL path (check for intermediate nodes before adding direct edge).\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] Given ['asia'], do(smoke) affects tub (avg_TVD=0.0036). Link is likely INDIRECT / fully mediated by current set.\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(smoke) affects lung (TVD=0.0055). This CONTRADICTS existence / SUPPORTS deletion.\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] Given ['bronc'], do(either) affects dysp (avg_TVD=0.2021).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

Thus, lung cancer directly causes the 'either' category.\n5. **either \u2192 xray**: An X-ray is used to detect abnormalities in the lungs, such as tuberculosis or lung cancer. Therefore, the presence of either condition (tub or lung) directly causes an X-ray to be performed.\n6. **bronc \u2192 dysp**: Bronchitis can cause shortness of breath (dyspnea).

Thus, smoking directly causes lung cancer.\n3. **tub \u2192 either**: Tuberculosis is a specific condition that can be considered as part of the 'either' category (tuberculosis or lung cancer).

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

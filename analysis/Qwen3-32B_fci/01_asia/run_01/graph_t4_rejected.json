To improve the model, we can explore whether the current edge 'asia \u2192 smoke' is sufficient or if we need to strengthen the indirect pathway to 'tub'. Since the edge 'asia \u2192 smoke' is already present and has not caused a drop in log-likelihood, we should consider whether 'smoke' has a stronger or clearer influence on 'tub' than currently represented. Therefore, we propose strengthening the causal influence by adding a direct edge from 'smoke' to 'tub', which is plausible as smoking can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to tuberculosis.

While 'asia' is an exogenous variable, it is reasonable to consider it as a causal influence on 'tub' based on epidemiological patterns. However, the previous attempt to add 'asia \u2192 tub' resulted in a decrease in log-likelihood, suggesting that this edge may not be fully supported by the data or may be redundant. Rather than adding it directly, we should investigate if there is a mediating variable that could link 'asia' and 'tub' more plausibly. One such candidate is 'smoke', which is a known risk factor for both 'tub' and 'lung', and is also influenced by geographic and cultural factors like those represented in 'asia'. Therefore, we consider adding a direct edge from 'asia' to 'smoke', which may indirectly influence 'tub' and 'lung' through its known effects on smoking behavior.

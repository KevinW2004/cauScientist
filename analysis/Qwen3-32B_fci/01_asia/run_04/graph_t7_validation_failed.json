Smoking is a well-established cause of bronchitis, so the correct direction should be smoke \u2192 bronc. Since reversing this edge directly is not feasible due to previous failures, we can instead consider adding a direct and known edge smoke \u2192 bronc, which is already in the confirmed_edges list. However, to ensure consistency and improve the graph\u2019s log-likelihood, we will DELETE the incorrect edge bronc \u2192 smoke and replace it with the correct direction.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

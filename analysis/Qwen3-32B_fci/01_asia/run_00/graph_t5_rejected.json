However, while smoking is a risk factor for many respiratory diseases, it is not a direct cause of tuberculosis, which is primarily caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. The inclusion of this edge may be introducing a spurious or overly simplistic causal relationship. Removing this edge better reflects the domain knowledge that tuberculosis is more directly influenced by ancestry (asia) and environmental exposure, rather than smoking alone.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - asia -> tub\n  - smoke -> lung\n  - smoke -> bronc\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - either -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - tub -> dysp\n  - lung -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  tub \u2192 dysp\n  lung \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20412.893615811743\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge smoke \u2192 tub not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -20429.4655, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'lung', 'xray')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge lung \u2192 either not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

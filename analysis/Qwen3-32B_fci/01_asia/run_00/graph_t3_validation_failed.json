While bronchitis may co-occur with lung cancer, it is primarily caused by smoking and is not a direct effect of lung cancer. Removing this edge would better reflect the causal relationships and align with the understanding that bronchitis is a separate condition that may coexist with lung cancer but is not caused by it.

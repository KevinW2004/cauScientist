The variable 'asia' is likely a binary indicator for whether the patient is from Asia, which may influence the likelihood of tuberculosis due to geographical prevalence. 'Either' is a logical OR of 'tub' and 'lung', indicating the presence of either condition.\n\nFrom domain knowledge and the provided hints:\n1. **Smoke** is a root node and a direct cause of **lung** and **bronc**. Smoking is a well-known risk factor for both lung cancer and bronchitis.\n2. **Asia** is a root node and a direct cause of **tub**, as tuberculosis is more prevalent in certain regions like Asia.\n3. **Tub** and **Lung** are both direct causes of **Either**, since 'Either' is defined as the presence of either condition.\n4. **Either** is a direct cause of **Xray**, since an x-ray is typically performed to detect either tuberculosis or lung cancer.\n5. **Bronc** is a direct cause of **Dysp**, as bronchitis can cause dyspnea.\n6. **Either** is also a direct cause of **Dysp**, as both tuberculosis and lung cancer can lead to shortness of breath.\n\nThe structure is acyclic and follows a clear temporal and causal order: risk factors (Asia, Smoke) \u2192 diseases (Tub, Lung, Bronc) \u2192 clinical findings (Either, Dysp, Xray).\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -22809.48556768597\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -22826.4389, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'tub', 'xray')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge tub \u2192 xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -22826.0550, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'lung', 'xray')]\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -25326.7831, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'either', 'xray')]\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge lung \u2192 xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge either \u2192 xray or xray \u2192 either not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: tub\u2192xray, tub\u2192xray, lung\u2192xray, lung\u2192xray; REVERSE: either\u2192xray, either\u2192xray\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

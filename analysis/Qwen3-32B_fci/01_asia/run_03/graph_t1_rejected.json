The goal is to represent the causal relationships between variables like smoking, tuberculosis (tub), lung cancer (lung), bronchitis (bronc), and symptoms like dyspnea (dysp) and x-ray findings (xray), with 'asia' being a root node (e.g., whether the patient is from Asia).\n\n1. **asia**: This is a root node in the domain; it does not have any direct causes. It may influence the likelihood of tuberculosis (tub), as tuberculosis is more prevalent in certain regions like Asia.\n2. **smoke**: This is also a root node. Smoking is an independent factor and can influence both lung cancer and bronchitis.\n3. **tub**: This is caused by the 'asia' variable, as geographic location (Asia) can increase the risk of tuberculosis. It can also contribute to the 'either' variable, which is a logical OR of tuberculosis and lung cancer.\n4. **lung**: Caused by 'smoke'. Smoking is a known cause of lung cancer.\n5. **either**: This is a logical OR of 'tub' and 'lung'. Therefore, both are direct causes of 'either'.\n6. **xray**: This is an effect of 'either'\u2014if the patient has either tuberculosis or lung cancer, it can be observed in an x-ray.\n7. **bronc**: Caused by 'smoke'. Smoking increases the risk of bronchitis.\n8. **dysp**: Caused by both 'bronc' and 'either'. Dyspnea (shortness of breath) can result from bronchitis or from either tuberculosis or lung cancer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the causal relationships are direct and acyclic, forming a DAG that reflects the medical understanding and temporal order of the variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -27229.553831693538\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

The variable 'asia' refers to being from Asia, which is often a risk factor for tuberculosis due to higher prevalence in certain regions.\n\n1. **asia \u2192 tub**: Being from Asia is a known risk factor for tuberculosis, as the disease is more prevalent in Asia. This is a direct causal relationship.\n2. **smoke \u2192 lung**: Smoking is a known cause of lung cancer. This is a direct causal relationship.\n3. **smoke \u2192 bronc**: Smoking is also a known cause of bronchitis. This is a direct causal relationship.\n4. **tub \u2192 either**: 'Either' is a derived variable indicating either tuberculosis or lung cancer. If a person has tuberculosis, they are in the 'either' category. This is a direct causal relationship.\n5. **lung \u2192 either**: Similarly, if a person has lung cancer, they are in the 'either' category. This is a direct causal relationship.\n6. **either \u2192 xray**: The presence of either tuberculosis or lung cancer causes an abnormal x-ray result. This is a direct causal relationship.\n7. **bronc \u2192 dysp**: Bronchitis causes dyspnea (shortness of breath). This is a direct causal relationship.\n8. **either \u2192 dysp**: Either having tuberculosis or lung cancer can also cause dyspnea. This is a direct causal relationship.\n\nNo cycles are present in the proposed graph, and all relationships are direct and based on domain knowledge and causal logic.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20067.114008542903\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -23617.8786, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'either', 'xray')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -20080.2574, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'tub', 'xray')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -20841.6555, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'either', 'dysp')]\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -20082.3710, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'bronc', 'xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: tub\u2192xray, bronc\u2192xray; DELETE: either\u2192xray, either\u2192dysp\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

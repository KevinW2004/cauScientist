Smoke is a known risk factor for lung cancer, and since **either** is a composite of **tub** and **lung**, it's plausible that the influence of **smoke** on **lung** indirectly affects **either**. However, **either** is a logical OR of **tub** and **lung**, so if **smoke** increases the likelihood of **lung**, and **lung** directly causes **either**, then **smoke** should also have a direct influence on **either** via **lung**. To better capture the indirect influence and improve the model's likelihood, we can consider adding a direct edge from **smoke** to **either**.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - asia -> tub\n  - smoke -> lung\n  - smoke -> bronc\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - either -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  smoke \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20712.0564804968\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -22809.4856, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'smoke', 'either')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -24330.9634, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'either', 'xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

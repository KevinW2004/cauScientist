We consider the following key points from domain knowledge and the provided baseline hints:\n\n1. **Smoking (smoke)** is a known risk factor for both **lung cancer (lung)** and **bronchitis (bronc)**. Therefore, smoke is a direct cause of both lung and bronc.\n\n2. **Tuberculosis (tub)** can be a cause of **either (either)**, which represents the presence of either tuberculosis or lung cancer. This is a standard abstraction in this domain.\n\n3. **Either (either)** is a cause of **xray (xray)**, as an X-ray is typically ordered to detect either condition.\n\n4. **Bronchitis (bronc)** and **either (either)** can both lead to **dyspnea (dysp)**, the symptom of shortness of breath.\n\n5. **Asia (asia)** is a binary variable indicating whether the patient is from Asia, which is a known risk factor for tuberculosis. Thus, asia is a direct cause of tub.\n\n6. Based on the FCI algorithm output, bronc \u2192 smoke is not a valid causal direction (smoke causes bronc, not vice versa), so we discard it. We also confirm the direct relationship between bronc and dysp is valid.\n\nThe final causal graph is built to reflect direct, domain-relevant, and acyclic relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20067.114008542903\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -22760.0286, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'lung', 'either')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge lung \u2192 either not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -23617.8786, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'either', 'xray')]\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -23651.9450, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'either', 'xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: lung\u2192either, lung\u2192either, either\u2192xray; REVERSE: either\u2192xray\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

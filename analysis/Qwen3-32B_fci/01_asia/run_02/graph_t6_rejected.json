The 'either' variable is a logical OR (tub or lung), and while it increases the likelihood of an x-ray, the decision for an x-ray might be more directly influenced by the presence of 'tub' or 'lung' individually, rather than the composite 'either'. Reversing the edge 'either \u2192 xray' to 'xray \u2192 either' may not be helpful, as previously failed. Instead, we consider reversing the edge 'tub \u2192 either' to 'either \u2192 tub' to explore if 'either' is a better parent of 'tub', which would make 'either' a more dominant condition type. This is a cautious, local adjustment to test the directionality of the 'either' variable in relation to specific diseases.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - asia -> tub\n  - smoke -> lung\n  - smoke -> bronc\n  - lung -> either\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 2):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  either \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -22794.62493765057\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -22809.4856, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'either', 'tub')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -26345.3896, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'either', 'xray')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -22811.1944, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'lung', 'xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

Age may influence symptom severity or progression, but not the etiology of the condition. While the previous attempt to delete this edge failed, we can focus on refining other parts of the graph to improve the model. One promising area is the relationship between 'CO2' and 'LungParench'. Since CO2 levels may reflect respiratory or cardiac function, and lung parenchyma status is a downstream outcome of disease or CO2 effects, we can evaluate whether the relationship should be reversed to better capture the causal direction.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> CO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 15):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  LungFlow \u2192 DuctFlow\n  DuctFlow \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  Disease \u2192 LungParench\n  HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 RUQO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Disease \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -134466.53053483035\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -134570.0805, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LungParench', 'CO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, 'Sick' itself is not explicitly connected to any upstream cause, which may limit the graph's explanatory power. Given that congenital heart disease often leads to systemic illness, it is plausible that 'Disease' causes 'Sick', making the relationship more temporally and causally coherent. Reversing the existing edge 'Sick \u2192 Disease' to 'Disease \u2192 Sick' better aligns with the expected physiological progression: disease manifests as sickness.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

ChestXray and LungParench are diagnostic tools and findings that are influenced by LungFlow and CO2 levels. CO2 levels affect lung parenchyma, and LungFlow affects chest X-ray results. HypDistrib and HypoxiaInO2 are physiological states that are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2 are indicators of regional oxygenation and are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow.

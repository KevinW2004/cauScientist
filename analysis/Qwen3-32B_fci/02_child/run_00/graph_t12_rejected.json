Grunting is a specific clinical sign that may be more directly influenced by underlying lung pathology rather than a general state of being 'Sick'. LungParench is already connected to Grunting, but we hypothesize that this relationship is more central than the 'Sick \u2192 Grunting' path. To better reflect the causal mechanism, we propose strengthening the 'LungParench \u2192 Grunting' edge by making it a confirmed relationship, as parenchymal lung disease is a known cause of respiratory distress and grunting in neonates.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LungParench -> Grunting\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 11):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155218.10010627663\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: LL too low: -144392.8645, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 9: LL too low: -143278.7315, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, 'Sick' also currently has a direct edge to 'Grunting', and 'Disease' also has a direct edge to 'Grunting'. This suggests that 'Grunting' is influenced by both 'Disease' and 'Sick'. However, since 'Sick' is already downstream of 'Disease', the direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' may be redundant or unnecessary. Removing this edge could simplify the graph and improve its log-likelihood by reducing overfitting or redundancy.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142960.28409630968\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

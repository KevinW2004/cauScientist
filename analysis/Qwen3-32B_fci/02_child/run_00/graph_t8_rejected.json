One potential refinement is to evaluate whether the relationship between 'Sick' and 'Grunting' is direct or if it is mediated by other factors such as respiratory distress or hypoxia. Since grunting is a clinical sign that can be a direct consequence of being sick, particularly in neonates with respiratory compromise, the current edge 'Sick \u2192 Grunting' appears plausible. At this stage, we propose no changes to this edge, but we document it for further validation.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> LowerBodyO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -156478.06247669942\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -156497.3684, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypoxiaInO2', 'Grunting')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

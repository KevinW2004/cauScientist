Starting with the foundational variable, Age can influence the progression and presentation of Disease. BirthAsphyxia is a known cause of systemic illness and can lead to Disease. LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) and LungFlow are both physiological responses or consequences of underlying cardiac disease, so they can directly cause or reflect Disease. Sick is a broad indicator of clinical status that can lead to Disease or be a symptom of it. Grunting is a clinical sign of respiratory distress and is likely caused by Sick or Disease. ChestXray and LungParench are diagnostic tools and findings that are influenced by LungFlow and CO2 levels. CO2 levels affect lung parenchyma, and LungFlow affects chest X-ray results. HypDistrib and HypoxiaInO2 are physiological states that are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2 are indicators of regional oxygenation and are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. Reports like XrayReport, GruntingReport, and CO2Report are downstream consequences of their respective measurements. LVHreport is a report of LVH and is not a cause but a record. All relationships are designed to be direct and acyclic, respecting temporal and causal ordering.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -147103.09204828818\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 Disease not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -147167.6152, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LVH', 'CardiacMixing')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Starting with the foundational variable, Age can influence the progression and presentation of Disease. BirthAsphyxia is a known cause of systemic illness and can lead to Disease. LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) and LungFlow are both physiological responses or consequences of underlying cardiac disease, so they can directly cause or reflect Disease. Sick is a broad indicator of clinical status that can lead to Disease or be a symptom of it. Grunting is a clinical sign of respiratory distress and is likely caused by Sick or Disease. ChestXray and LungParench are diagnostic tools and findings that are influenced by LungFlow and CO2 levels. CO2 levels affect lung parenchyma, and LungFlow affects chest X-ray results. HypDistrib and HypoxiaInO2 are physiological states that are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2 are indicators of regional oxygenation and are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. Reports like XrayReport, GruntingReport, and CO2Report are downstream consequences of their respective measurements. LVHreport is a report of LVH and is not a cause but a record. All relationships are designed to be direct and acyclic, respecting temporal and causal ordering.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -147103.09204828818\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Starting with the foundational variable, Age can influence the progression and presentation of Disease. BirthAsphyxia is a known cause of systemic illness and can lead to Disease. LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) and LungFlow are both physiological responses or consequences of underlying cardiac disease, so they can directly cause or reflect Disease. Sick is a broad indicator of clinical status that can lead to Disease or be a symptom of it. Grunting is a clinical sign of respiratory distress and is likely caused by Sick or Disease. ChestXray and LungParench are diagnostic tools and findings that are influenced by LungFlow and CO2 levels. CO2 levels affect lung parenchyma, and LungFlow affects chest X-ray results. HypDistrib and HypoxiaInO2 are physiological states that are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2 are indicators of regional oxygenation and are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. Reports like XrayReport, GruntingReport, and CO2Report are downstream consequences of their respective measurements. LVHreport is a report of LVH and is not a cause but a record. All relationships are designed to be direct and acyclic, respecting temporal and causal ordering.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -147103.09204828818\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 Disease not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

This addition would better reflect the physiological mechanism and may improve the graph's log-likelihood by adding a more direct causal link.\",\n  \"confirmed_edges\": [\"Age -> Disease\", \"BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\", \"LVH -> Disease\", \"Sick -> Disease\", \"LungFlow -> Disease\", \"Disease -> CO2\", \"Disease -> CardiacMixing\", \"Disease -> DuctFlow\", \"CO2 -> LungParench\", \"LungFlow -> LungParench\", \"CardiacMixing -> HypDistrib\", \"DuctFlow -> HypDistrib\", \"CardiacMixing -> HypoxiaInO2\", \"DuctFlow -> HypoxiaInO2\", \"CardiacMixing -> LowerBodyO2\", \"DuctFlow -> LowerBodyO2\", \"CardiacMixing -> RUQO2\", \"DuctFlow -> RUQO2\", \"LungFlow -> ChestXray\", \"LungParench -> ChestXray\", \"ChestXray -> XrayReport\", \"Sick -> Grunting\", \"Disease -> Grunting\", \"Grunting -> GruntingReport\", \"CO2 -> CO2Report\", \"LVH -> LVHreport\"],\n  \"edge_notes\": {\n    \"LVH -> CardiacMixing\": \"Plausible based on physiological mechanisms, but needs validation.\"\n  },\n  \"operations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ADD\",\n      \"parent\": \"LVH\",\n      \"child\": \"CardiacMixing\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"LVH can alter intracardiac flow dynamics and lead to cardiac mixing, making this a plausible and direct causal relationship.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Starting with the foundational variable, Age can influence the progression and presentation of Disease. BirthAsphyxia is a known cause of systemic illness and can lead to Disease. LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) and LungFlow are both physiological responses or consequences of underlying cardiac disease, so they can directly cause or reflect Disease. Sick is a broad indicator of clinical status that can lead to Disease or be a symptom of it. Grunting is a clinical sign of respiratory distress and is likely caused by Sick or Disease. ChestXray and LungParench are diagnostic tools and findings that are influenced by LungFlow and CO2 levels. CO2 levels affect lung parenchyma, and LungFlow affects chest X-ray results. HypDistrib and HypoxiaInO2 are physiological states that are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2 are indicators of regional oxygenation and are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. Reports like XrayReport, GruntingReport, and CO2Report are downstream consequences of their respective measurements. LVHreport is a report of LVH and is not a cause but a record. All relationships are designed to be direct and acyclic, respecting temporal and causal ordering.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -147103.09204828818\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 Disease not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -147167.6152, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LVH', 'CardiacMixing')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

Starting with the foundational variable, Age can influence the progression and presentation of Disease. BirthAsphyxia is a known cause of systemic illness and can lead to Disease. LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) and LungFlow are both physiological responses or consequences of underlying cardiac disease, so they can directly cause or reflect Disease. Sick is a broad indicator of clinical status that can lead to Disease or be a symptom of it. Grunting is a clinical sign of respiratory distress and is likely caused by Sick or Disease. ChestXray and LungParench are diagnostic tools and findings that are influenced by LungFlow and CO2 levels. CO2 levels affect lung parenchyma, and LungFlow affects chest X-ray results. HypDistrib and HypoxiaInO2 are physiological states that are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. LowerBodyO2 and RUQO2 are indicators of regional oxygenation and are influenced by CardiacMixing and DuctFlow. Reports like XrayReport, GruntingReport, and CO2Report are downstream consequences of their respective measurements. LVHreport is a report of LVH and is not a cause but a record. All relationships are designed to be direct and acyclic, respecting temporal and causal ordering.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -147103.09204828818\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CardiacMixing \u2192 Disease not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -147167.6152, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LVH', 'CardiacMixing')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -147195.0654, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'CO2', 'Grunting')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, 'Sick' itself is not explicitly connected to any upstream cause, which may limit the graph's explanatory power. Given that congenital heart disease often leads to systemic illness, it is plausible that 'Disease' causes 'Sick', making the relationship more temporally and causally coherent. Reversing the existing edge 'Sick \u2192 Disease' to 'Disease \u2192 Sick' better aligns with the expected physiological progression: disease manifests as sickness.

However, 'Sick' itself is not explicitly connected to any upstream cause, which may limit the graph's explanatory power. Given that congenital heart disease often leads to systemic illness, it is plausible that 'Disease' causes 'Sick', making the relationship more temporally and causally coherent. Reversing the existing edge 'Sick \u2192 Disease' to 'Disease \u2192 Sick' better aligns with the expected physiological progression: disease manifests as sickness.

Further interventional data could clarify its necessity.\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"Disease\",\n    \"child\": \"Grunting\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Removing the direct edge from Disease to Grunting reduces redundancy, as Grunting is already influenced by Disease through the intermediary variable Sick.

However, 'Sick' also currently has a direct edge to 'Grunting', and 'Disease' also has a direct edge to 'Grunting'. This suggests that 'Grunting' is influenced by both 'Disease' and 'Sick'. However, since 'Sick' is already downstream of 'Disease', the direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' may be redundant or unnecessary. Removing this edge could simplify the graph and improve its log-likelihood by reducing overfitting or redundancy.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142960.28409630968\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: LL too low: -144392.8645, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

The direct edge from 'Disease' to 'Grunting' is likely redundant because the influence of 'Disease' on 'Grunting' is already captured through the path 'Disease \u2192 Sick \u2192 Grunting'. This redundancy can reduce model efficiency and log-likelihood. While previous attempts to remove the 'Disease \u2192 Grunting' edge failed, we should explore other local modifications that may simplify the graph and improve performance. A promising candidate is the edge 'CO2 \u2192 CO2Report'. This edge may be redundant, as 'CO2Report' is likely a direct human interpretation of the 'CO2' measurement and not a causal consequence of it. Removing this edge may improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  DuctFlow \u2192 RUQO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -142959.6156427423\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO2 \u2192 CO2Report or CO2Report \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: LL too low: -144392.8645, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 9: LL too low: -143278.7315, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

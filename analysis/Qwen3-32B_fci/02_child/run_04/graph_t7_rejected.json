In neonatal cardiology, elevated CO2 can be a consequence of poor lung function and systemic hypoxia, which are themselves indicators or consequences of cardiac disease. A more plausible relationship is that Disease may influence CO2 levels, rather than the other way around. Reversing the CO2 \u2192 LungParench edge to LungParench \u2192 CO2 aligns with the causal direction where lung parenchymal disease influences CO2 retention, rather than the reverse. This change respects the physiological mechanism and is consistent with the domain context.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\n  - LVH -> Disease\n  - LungFlow -> Disease\n  - Sick -> Disease\n  - Age -> Disease\n  - LungParench -> CO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -157089.71704682926\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -157200.4768, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'CO2', 'LungParench')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -157323.1839, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 CO2 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

'Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport' is also valid, as a clinical observation leads to a report. The graph is currently a DAG with no cycles. A potential improvement is to consider the edge 'Disease \u2192 Grunting', as grunting may be a manifestation of an underlying disease. This would enhance the model by capturing the causal pathway from disease to symptoms.

However, in neonates with congenital heart disease, impaired lung parenchyma (e.g., due to infection or edema) often leads to CO2 retention, making CO2 a consequence of lung parenchyma dysfunction. Reversing this edge to CO2 \u2190 LungParench would better align with the causal mechanism. Given the repeated failure to reverse this edge in prior attempts, I will instead explore a different edge for refinement. A plausible candidate is the edge 'LungFlow \u2192 Disease', which may not fully capture the causal influence of lung flow on diagnostic outcomes. Reversing it to 'Disease \u2192 LungFlow' could better reflect that the presence of congenital heart disease may alter lung flow patterns.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\n  - LVH -> Disease\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 15):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  Disease \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -154296.25943897542\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

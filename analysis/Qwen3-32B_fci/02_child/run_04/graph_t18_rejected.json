However, the relationship between Disease and CO2 remains indirect. Given that congenital heart disease (Disease) can impact lung function and systemic gas exchange, it is plausible that Disease may influence CO2 levels indirectly via LungParench. This suggests a potential path: Disease \u2192 LungParench \u2192 CO2. To improve the causal structure, we consider adding a direct influence from Disease to LungParench, which would allow for a more complete causal chain from Disease to CO2.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\n  - LVH -> Disease\n  - LungFlow -> Disease\n  - Sick -> Disease\n  - Age -> Disease\n  - LungParench -> CO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 12):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 LungParench\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155822.9984147786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -162175.9059, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Disease', 'LungParench')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -156056.4843, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -156009.0910, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LungFlow', 'LungParench')]\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge LungFlow \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: LL too low: -155919.5113, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypDistrib', 'LungParench')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

To better capture the downstream effects of HypoxiaInO2, we should consider its influence on clinical indicators like Grunting and CO2Report. However, direct links from HypoxiaInO2 to these variables have previously failed. A more plausible and indirect pathway may be through HypDistrib, which represents hypoxia distribution and is known to influence both Grunting and CO2Report.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

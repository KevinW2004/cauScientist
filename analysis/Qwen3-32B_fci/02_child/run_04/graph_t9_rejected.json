To better capture the downstream effects of HypoxiaInO2, we should consider its influence on clinical indicators like Grunting and CO2Report. However, direct links from HypoxiaInO2 to these variables have previously failed. A more plausible and indirect pathway may be through HypDistrib, which represents hypoxia distribution and is known to influence both Grunting and CO2Report. Adding a link from HypoxiaInO2 to HypDistrib would better capture the causal pathway and potentially improve the likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> HypoxiaInO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 7):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -156283.16710902276\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 HypDistrib not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While a direct causal reversal is not allowed, a more plausible indirect influence might be through diagnostic reports, such as ChestXray or XrayReport, which integrate both CO2 status and parenchyma findings. A more appropriate and valid addition would be to test whether CO2 influences the interpretation of lung parenchyma via the XrayReport, which is a downstream variable.

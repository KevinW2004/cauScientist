However, based on physiological understanding in the context of congenital heart disease, it is more plausible that changes in lung parenchyma (e.g., due to disease or poor gas exchange) can lead to elevated CO2 levels as a downstream consequence. Reversing this edge to 'CO2 \u2190 LungParench' (i.e., 'LungParench \u2192 CO2') is already present, so no reversal is needed. However, to better reflect the causal direction, we confirm the edge 'LungParench \u2192 CO2' as a confirmed relationship, aligning with the causal mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LungParench -> CO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 11):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungParench \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -146853.86449268615\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 LungParench not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

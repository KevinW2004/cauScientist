However, the relationship between HypDistrib and RUQO2 remains unmodeled despite prior failed attempts to directly connect them. Given that RUQO2 is a regional oxygen saturation measurement, and HypDistrib is a systemic descriptor of hypoxia patterns, it is plausible that RUQO2 is also influenced by HypDistrib. However, since the direct edge failed in previous attempts, it may be that the influence is indirect or mediated through another variable. A more strategic next step is to explore if a variable like LungFlow or LungParench could mediate the relationship between HypDistrib and RUQO2. For now, we will focus on adding a well-supported and local edge: HypDistrib \u2192 RUQO2 is not viable due to prior failures, but we can consider a local refinement in the ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport relationship, which is a natural diagnostic process. Adding this edge improves modeling of the diagnostic workflow.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> HypDistrib\n  - HypDistrib -> LowerBodyO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 10):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  HypDistrib \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -149814.279940183\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -150119.8438, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LungParench', 'XrayReport')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -149830.0166, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LungFlow', 'LungParench')]\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, in clinical practice, CO2 levels can also be influenced by lung parenchyma abnormalities, and CO2 levels themselves can affect the interpretation of lung parenchyma findings in diagnostic settings. This mutual influence suggests a need to consider whether the relationship is truly unidirectional. Reversing this edge is not the goal, but we can test for a more complete causal link by adding a reverse influence, if plausible. Adding a bidirectional link is not allowed in a DAG, so instead, we can test whether CO2 should be a parent of LungParench in parallel with the existing edge. However, since the existing edge is LungParench \u2192 CO2, and the proposed reversal is excluded, we focus on adding a new edge that may better reflect the diagnostic process, such as the influence of LungFlow on LungParench, which is not currently represented.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\n  - LVH -> Disease\n  - LungFlow -> Disease\n  - Sick -> Disease\n  - Age -> Disease\n  - LungFlow -> ChestXray\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 LungParench\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -157031.34616810567\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

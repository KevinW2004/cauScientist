However, grunting is a clinical sign that is more likely to be reported (GruntingReport) as a result of observing grunting. This suggests that 'Grunting' is a direct cause of 'GruntingReport'. The current edge 'Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport' is already in place, and no further cycles or conflicts are introduced. Therefore, no additional changes are needed at this time, but the graph remains consistent with domain knowledge.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 4):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155147.045198883\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -155166.3606, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypoxiaInO2', 'Grunting')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

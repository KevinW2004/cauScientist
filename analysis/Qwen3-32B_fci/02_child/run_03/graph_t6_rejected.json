Age is a root node as it is a baseline characteristic. BirthAsphyxia is a known risk factor that may contribute to disease. Disease is a central node that can manifest in various forms, including structural (e.g., LVH), functional (e.g., CardiacMixing), and clinical (e.g., Grunting). LungFlow affects ChestXray findings, and CO2 levels can affect LungParench. Variables like GruntingReport, CO2Report, XrayReport, and LVHreport are observational reports that are influenced by the actual clinical findings (e.g., Grunting, CO2, Xray, LVH). The relationships are based on temporal ordering and clinical causality. For example, Disease causes specific clinical signs (e.g., Grunting, LVH), and those signs may be reported. No cycles are introduced to maintain the DAG structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  Disease \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  Disease \u2192 RUQO2\n  Disease \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -144542.06098009087\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -144570.9894, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'CO2', 'Grunting')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -144713.2363, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Disease', 'CO2')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -144554.4319, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Disease', 'Grunting')]\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

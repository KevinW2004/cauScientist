However, the edge 'Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport' is already present in the graph but was previously rejected as an operation. This suggests that the edge is valid but not actionable for modification. To improve the model, we should consider whether any other edges can be added or refined to better represent the causal structure. A plausible candidate is adding the edge 'Disease \u2192 Grunting', as grunting can be a symptom of underlying disease, and 'Disease' is already connected to 'Sick', which is connected to 'Grunting'. This edge would help formalize the causal pathway from disease to observable symptoms and their reports.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 6):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Disease \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155098.29264654423\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

In congenital heart disease, CO2 levels are often a downstream physiological consequence of impaired oxygenation and ventilation due to cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, it is more plausible that Disease causes CO2 changes rather than the reverse. However, there may be a feedback mechanism in severe disease, so this relationship requires careful evaluation. Since the current edge is 'Disease \u2192 CO2', I do not see a need for reversal at this stage. Instead, I propose adding a direct causal link from 'CO2' to 'HypoxiaInO2', as elevated CO2 levels can worsen oxygenation by contributing to acidosis and reducing oxygen delivery.

For example, I do not include reverse relationships like Disease \u2192 BirthAsphyxia, as BirthAsphyxia is a pre-existing condition. All relationships are based on clinical understanding and temporal precedence.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  Disease \u2192 CO2\n  Disease \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  Disease \u2192 RUQO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -131818.2280876212\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

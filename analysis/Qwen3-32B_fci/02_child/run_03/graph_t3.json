However, it lacks the analogous relationship for other signs, such as CO2 measurements and their documentation (CO2Report), and LungParench findings and their documentation (XrayReport). These are standard medical practices where observed signs lead to formal documentation.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

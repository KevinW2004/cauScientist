However, grunting is also a clinical sign that may be directly caused by respiratory distress or hypoxia, which are downstream effects of lung-related conditions or cardiac mixing. A more direct and plausible relationship is 'LungParench \u2192 Grunting', as parenchymal lung disease can cause grunting due to airway resistance and respiratory effort.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, a closer inspection suggests that the relationship between CO2 and LungParench may warrant refinement. In clinical practice, CO2 levels may not directly cause changes in lung parenchyma, but rather both could be influenced by an underlying condition like respiratory distress or disease.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

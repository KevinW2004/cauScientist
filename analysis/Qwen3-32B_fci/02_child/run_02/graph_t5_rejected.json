However, the relationship Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport is already confirmed in the Causal Dossier. The edge Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport was previously attempted to be added but failed due to constraints. Instead of adding it again, we should consider whether the existing edge is correct or whether there is a misalignment in the graph structure. A better approach is to examine other plausible local refinements. One such candidate is the relationship between CO2 and CO2Report, as CO2 measurements are likely to be reported, similar to Grunting and GruntingReport. Adding CO2 \u2192 CO2Report is a reasonable and analogous adjustment that aligns with the structure of other reporting relationships.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 4):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Sick \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -152774.06684417697\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

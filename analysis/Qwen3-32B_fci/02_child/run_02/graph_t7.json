However, based on domain knowledge, 'Sick' is more likely a downstream consequence of 'Disease', rather than a cause. This suggests that the edge 'Sick \u2192 Disease' is incorrectly directed. Reversing this edge to 'Disease \u2192 Sick' would better align with the causal mechanism, where disease leads to sickness. This change is expected to improve the log-likelihood by better modeling the causal direction and removing a cycle or misalignment in the current structure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155588.26959392225\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -157200.4768, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Sick', 'Disease')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -155746.4504, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Sick', 'Grunting')]\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 Grunting or Grunting \u2192 Sick not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 Grunting or Grunting \u2192 Sick not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: LL too low: -155798.8591, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Sick', 'Grunting')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

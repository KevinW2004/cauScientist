Instead of focusing on removing this edge, we consider adding a more direct and clinically plausible cause of grunting. Grunting is a common sign of respiratory distress, which can be directly caused by parenchymal lung disease. This relationship is already in the confirmed edges, but we can strengthen the causal model by exploring if 'LungParench \u2192 GruntingReport' is a plausible and direct relationship. This addition would reflect that parenchymal lung disease can directly influence the clinical report of grunting, improving the model's fit and interpretability.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - CO2 -> LungParench\n  - LungFlow -> ChestXray\n  - LungParench -> Grunting\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  Disease \u2192 BirthAsphyxia\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -153211.02366700544\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

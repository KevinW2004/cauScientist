However, we also have 'Sick \u2192 Grunting' and 'Disease \u2192 Sick', suggesting that disease-induced sickness may independently contribute to grunting. Given that grunting can be a direct clinical sign of both parenchymal lung disease and generalized illness, we should evaluate whether 'Sick' should directly influence 'GruntingReport' as well, since grunting is a clinical finding that is often reported in sick infants. This would make the graph more complete in reflecting how grunting is reported based on both direct lung pathology and generalized illness.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LungParench -> GruntingReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 16):\n  Disease \u2192 BirthAsphyxia\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 GruntingReport\n  Sick \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -153165.4502160621\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 GruntingReport not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

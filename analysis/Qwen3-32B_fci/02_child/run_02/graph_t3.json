However, in the context of congenital heart disease, it is more plausible that the presence of a disease (e.g., congenital heart disease) leads to symptoms of being sick. Therefore, reversing the edge from 'Sick \u2192 Disease' to 'Disease \u2192 Sick' better aligns with the causal direction in this domain. This reversal is likely to improve the log-likelihood by correcting the direction of causality and aligning with clinical understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155588.26959392225\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -157200.4768, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Sick', 'Disease')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

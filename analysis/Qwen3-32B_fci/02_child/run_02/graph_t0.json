It can lead to systemic hypoxia and cardiac stress, potentially causing or contributing to **Disease**.\n2. **LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy)** is a structural heart abnormality that can result from congenital heart disease. Therefore, **Disease** may cause **LVH**.\n3. **LVHreport** is a diagnostic observation and should be a result of **LVH**, not a cause.\n4. **DuctFlow** and **CardiacMixing** are indicators of abnormal blood flow patterns in the heart, which are manifestations of **Disease**.\n5. **HypDistrib** (hypoxia distribution) and **LungParench** (lung parenchyma abnormalities) are downstream effects of **Disease** and **HypoxiaInO2**. Lung parenchyma issues can also be caused by high CO2 levels.\n6. **CO2** and **LowerBodyO2** are physiological indicators that reflect the severity of disease and hypoxia. **CO2Report** is a diagnostic report of **CO2** levels and should be a result of it.\n7. **LungFlow** is a diagnostic parameter that reflects lung function, which is affected by **Disease** and **LungParench**.\n8. **ChestXray** is a diagnostic tool, and **XrayReport** is a result of the **ChestXray** findings.\n9. **Sick** is a general clinical assessment that likely reflects the overall severity of **Disease** and is a precursor to observable symptoms like **Grunting**.\n10. **Grunting** is a symptom of respiratory distress, often caused by **Sick** status and **HypoxiaInO2**. **GruntingReport** is a diagnostic report of grunting behavior.\n11. **Age** is a demographic factor that may influence the likelihood and progression of **Disease**.\n\nI ensure the graph is acyclic and all relationships are direct.

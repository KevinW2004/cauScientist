LungFlow is already influenced by **LungParench** and **CO2**, both of which are downstream of Disease via **HypoxiaInO2** and **CO2**. This suggests that the direct influence of Disease on LungFlow may be redundant or mediated through these intermediate variables. Removing this edge could reduce model complexity and improve log-likelihood without losing explanatory power, especially if the indirect pathways are sufficient to explain LungFlow behavior.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HypoxiaInO2 -> LowerBodyO2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 15):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 HypDistrib\n  Disease \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungParench \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -153667.3535417208\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Disease \u2192 LungFlow not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

This suggests a constraint in the system regarding how 'Sick' can influence 'GruntingReport'. Given the clinical plausibility of sickness contributing to grunting and its subsequent reporting, the focus should shift to testing alternative paths. Since 'Sick \u2192 Grunting' is already present, and 'Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport' is a logical downstream effect, we can test the addition of a direct edge 'Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport' to better model the reporting mechanism.

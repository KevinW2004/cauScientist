However, grunting is also a clinical sign that may be directly caused by respiratory distress or hypoxia, which are downstream effects of lung-related conditions or cardiac mixing. A more direct and plausible relationship is 'LungParench \u2192 Grunting', as parenchymal lung disease can cause grunting due to airway resistance and respiratory effort. Adding this edge aligns better with the clinical mechanism and may improve the model's fit.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - CO2 -> LungParench\n  - LungFlow -> ChestXray\n  - LungParench -> Grunting\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 4):\n  Disease \u2192 BirthAsphyxia\n  LVH \u2192 Disease\n  LungFlow \u2192 Disease\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  CO2 \u2192 LungParench\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -153679.02803794682\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -153873.6512, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Sick', 'Grunting')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -153773.0995, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HypoxiaInO2', 'Grunting')]\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge Sick \u2192 Grunting not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

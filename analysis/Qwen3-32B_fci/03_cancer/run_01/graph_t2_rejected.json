The primary risk factors for lung cancer are known to be smoking (Smoker) and environmental factors such as air Pollution. These two factors can directly influence the development of Cancer. Cancer, in turn, can lead to observable symptoms such as Dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and can also result in medical procedures like Xray being performed. However, Xray is not a direct cause of Dyspnoea; rather, both may be consequences of Cancer. Smoker and Pollution are independent risk factors that may also influence each other indirectly (e.g., smokers might be more aware of environmental risks), but there is no strong evidence for a direct causal link from Pollution to Smoker. Therefore, the direct causal relationships include Pollution \u2192 Cancer, Smoker \u2192 Cancer, Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea, and Cancer \u2192 Xray. The relationship between Pollution and Xray is likely indirect (via Cancer or symptoms), and the same applies to Smoker \u2192 Xray. Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea is not a direct causal link and is omitted. The final causal graph is a DAG that reflects these direct, domain-consistent relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -17847.9193, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Smoker', 'Xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

This is implausible from a causal standpoint\u2014Dyspnoea is a symptom that may lead to an X-ray, not the other way around. Reversing this edge to Dyspnoea \u2192 Xray would better align with clinical reasoning, where symptoms like Dyspnoea prompt diagnostic tests such as X-rays.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the edge Smoker \u2192 Xray has been previously attempted for deletion but failed, likely because it was not present in the current graph. Upon re-evaluation, this edge is not part of the current graph, so no action is needed. Instead, we examine the current structure for potential local refinements. One candidate for improvement is the edge Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea. While it is plausible that cancer causes dyspnoea (shortness of breath), it is also possible that dyspnoea is a symptom that leads to the detection of cancer, especially through diagnostic pathways like X-ray. This suggests a potential reversal of the edge Dyspnoea \u2192 Cancer could be considered. However, reversing this edge would require strong evidence that dyspnoea leads to cancer, which is not supported by current medical knowledge. Thus, we propose no further changes at this stage and instead document the uncertainty for further investigation.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Cancer\n  - Cancer -> Xray\n  - Pollution -> Dyspnoea\n  - Smoker -> Dyspnoea\n  - Cancer -> Dyspnoea\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17880.520620237465\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

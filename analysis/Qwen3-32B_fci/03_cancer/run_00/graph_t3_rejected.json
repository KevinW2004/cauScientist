While the direct 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' edge cannot be deleted (as previously attempted), it is still useful to reinforce the indirect path via Cancer. Therefore, we propose adding the edge 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' via the Cancer node, but since that edge is already present, we instead focus on reinforcing the indirect path by adding a direct edge from Smoker to Xray (if not already in the graph). However, since the graph already includes 'Smoker \u2192 Xray', we must consider a different refinement. Instead, we propose adding a new edge that may be missing: 'Xray \u2192 Dyspnoea', as the presence of an X-ray may influence the observation of dyspnoea due to diagnostic follow-up or psychological factors. This addition would improve the model\u2019s explanatory power without violating DAG constraints.",

However, upon closer inspection, the edge 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' may be over-simplified. A more accurate causal path would involve Cancer as an intermediary, since smoking increases the risk of cancer, which in turn leads to X-ray investigations. This suggests that 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' may be a spurious or indirect edge, and the true causal path is 'Smoker \u2192 Cancer \u2192 Xray'.

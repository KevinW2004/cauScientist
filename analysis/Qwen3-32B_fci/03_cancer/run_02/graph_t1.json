It may also influence the probability of a person becoming a smoker due to socioeconomic or environmental factors.\n\n2. **Smoker**: Smoking is a well-established cause of lung cancer. It is also independent of pollution, though both can co-occur. Smoking can lead to cancer directly and can also cause dyspnoea (shortness of breath) independently.\n\n3. **Cancer**: This is the central outcome of interest. It is caused by both pollution and smoking. Cancer can lead to symptoms such as dyspnoea and may also influence the likelihood of an X-ray being performed.\n\n4. **Xray**: An X-ray is a diagnostic tool that is often ordered when there is suspicion of cancer, which is influenced by symptoms like dyspnoea or a history of smoking/pollution exposure. However, X-ray is not a cause of cancer, but rather a diagnostic response.\n\n5. **Dyspnoea**: This is a symptom that can result from cancer or from smoking, and it can also be influenced by pollution. It may also be a reason for ordering an X-ray.\n\nFrom these considerations, the direct causal relationships are:\n- Pollution causes Cancer and may influence Smoker.\n- Smoker causes Cancer and Dyspnoea.\n- Cancer causes Dyspnoea and may influence Xray.\n- Dyspnoea may influence Xray.\n\nThe FCI algorithm suggested many indirect relationships, but not all of them are direct. For instance, Pollution \u2192 Xray is indirect and mediated by Cancer or Dyspnoea. Similarly, Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea is indirect via Cancer.

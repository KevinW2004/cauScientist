However, the causal relationship between Pollution and Xray is questionable. While pollution can cause lung damage, Xrays are more directly indicative of structural changes, such as those caused by Cancer, rather than being a direct effect of Pollution. Removing this edge would make the model more aligned with the mechanism that Xrays primarily reflect anatomical abnormalities caused by Cancer, rather than environmental exposure alone. This change should improve the model's log-likelihood and causal coherence.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Xray\n  - Cancer -> Xray\n  - Smoker -> Dyspnoea\n  - Cancer -> Dyspnoea\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17895.67269193829\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

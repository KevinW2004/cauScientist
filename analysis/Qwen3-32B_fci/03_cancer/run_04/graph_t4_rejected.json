While pollution can contribute to respiratory issues, dyspnoea is more directly a symptom of cancer or a consequence of chronic exposure to pollution over a longer time. However, the edge from Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea may not be a direct causal link in most cases. Instead, pollution may contribute to the development of cancer, which in turn leads to dyspnoea. Removing this edge would make the graph more consistent with the idea that dyspnoea is primarily a downstream effect of cancer rather than a direct result of pollution.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Cancer\n  - Cancer -> Dyspnoea\n  - Smoker -> Dyspnoea\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17847.91931382617\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -18680.2282, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Cancer', 'Xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

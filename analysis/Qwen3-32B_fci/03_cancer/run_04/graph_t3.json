While it is true that these factors can increase the likelihood of undergoing an Xray, the direct causal link from Pollution \u2192 Xray is less plausible. Xray is more directly a diagnostic response to symptoms or conditions like Cancer or Dyspnoea, rather than a direct consequence of environmental exposure.

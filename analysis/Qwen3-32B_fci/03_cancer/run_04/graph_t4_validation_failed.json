While smoking can increase the likelihood of cancer, which in turn increases the likelihood of undergoing an Xray, the direct influence of smoking on Xray decisions is less plausible. Xrays are typically ordered in response to symptoms (e.g., Dyspnoea) or a diagnosed condition (e.g., Cancer), rather than as a direct result of being a smoker. Removing this direct edge would better align the graph with clinical diagnostic practices and improve the model's causal coherence.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution -> Smoker\n  - Pollution -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Cancer\n  - Cancer -> Xray\n  - Cancer -> Dyspnoea\n  - Smoker -> Dyspnoea\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  Pollution \u2192 Smoker\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17856.21477773902\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

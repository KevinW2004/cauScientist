However, this may be an indirect relationship. A more plausible mechanism is that both Pollution and Smoker increase the risk of Cancer, and it is the presence of Cancer (or its symptoms) that leads to an X-ray being conducted. Therefore, the direct causal edge from Pollution \u2192 Xray and Smoker \u2192 Xray may be overfitting or capturing spurious correlations. Removing these edges would simplify the graph and better align with the causal mechanism that Cancer is the primary driver of X-ray detection, not pollution or smoking alone.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Cancer\n  - Cancer -> Xray\n  - Cancer -> Dyspnoea\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17846.10375634631\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

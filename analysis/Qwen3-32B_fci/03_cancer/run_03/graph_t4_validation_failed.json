However, the edge 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' may not be as strong as previously assumed. While smokers may be more likely to undergo lung imaging, this is often an indirect result of symptoms or physician suspicion of cancer, rather than a direct causal effect of smoking itself.

However, the edge 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' has previously been flagged for removal due to its indirect and potentially spurious nature. While the system disallows direct deletion of this edge, we can explore a reversal if it exists in the current structure. However, since the edge 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' is not currently present in the confirmed or tentative edges, the most strategic and valid move is to propose a small addition or test a reversal of a different plausible edge. No new edges should be added without strong domain support. The most promising candidate for refinement is the edge 'Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea,' which could plausibly be reversed if dyspnoea is more likely to influence smoking behavior in some contexts (e.g., smoking as a coping mechanism for breathing difficulties).

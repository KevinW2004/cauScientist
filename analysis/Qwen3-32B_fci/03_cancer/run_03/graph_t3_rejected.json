However, the edge 'Smoker \u2192 Xray' may not be as strong as previously assumed. While smokers may be more likely to undergo lung imaging, this is often an indirect result of symptoms or physician suspicion of cancer, rather than a direct causal effect of smoking itself. Removing this edge could improve the graph\u2019s accuracy and reduce spurious relationships.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Cancer\n  - Cancer -> Xray\n  - Cancer -> Dyspnoea\n  - Smoker -> Dyspnoea\n  - Pollution -> Dyspnoea\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Smoker \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Pollution \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17880.520620237465\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Smoker \u2192 Xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

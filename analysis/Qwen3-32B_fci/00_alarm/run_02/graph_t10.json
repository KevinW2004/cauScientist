To clarify whether it is direct or indirect, we should test the effect of intervening on LVFAILURE and observing CVP while controlling for potential confounders like PCWP and LVEDVOLUME. Additionally, we explore other potentially indirect or missing links in the graph that may benefit from experimental validation, such as the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and BP, or between TPR and HRBP, which could be either direct or mediated through other variables.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the causal link from LVFAILURE to CVP may be indirect. Removing this edge and observing the effect through experiments can help determine if the influence is mediated by other variables such as PCWP or LVEDVOLUME.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is known to affect blood pressure (BP) in clinical settings, but this direct link is not yet represented in the graph. Adding this edge could improve the model\u2019s explanatory power and align it with domain knowledge.)\n3. REVERSE: TPR \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: The current graph has TPR \u2192 BP, and ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP. It is possible that the causal influence of TPR on HRBP is not direct but rather through BP. Reversing or removing this edge could help clarify the actual causal pathway.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME (TVD=0.1756).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192CVP, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME; REVERSE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

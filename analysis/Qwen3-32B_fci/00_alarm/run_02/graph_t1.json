The goal is to identify direct causal relationships that align with domain knowledge and avoid cycles to ensure the graph is a DAG.\n\n1. **HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE** are root causes of reduced cardiac output and volume status. Both directly affect **LVEDVOLUME** and **STROKEVOLUME**, which are downstream indicators of cardiac function.\n\n2. **LVEDVOLUME** is a direct determinant of **CVP** and **PCWP**, as it influences venous return and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.\n\n3. **STROKEVOLUME** is a primary determinant of **CO** (cardiac output), which in turn affects **BP** (blood pressure) and **HR** (heart rate) in response to changes in output.\n\n4. **TPR** (total peripheral resistance) is influenced by **CATECHOL** (catecholamine use), which is often used to increase vascular tone and support BP.\n\n5. **FIO2** (fraction of inspired oxygen) directly influences **PVSAT** (pulmonary venous saturation) and indirectly **SAO2** (oxygen saturation in arterial blood), as higher oxygen delivery increases arterial oxygen levels.\n\n6. **VENTMACH** (ventilator use) and **INTUBATION** are mechanical interventions that influence **VENTTUBE** (ventilator tubing) and **VENTLUNG** (ventilator-lung interaction). **KINKEDTUBE** and **DISCONNECT** are common ventilator malfunctions that affect **PRESS** (pressure).\n\n7. **PULMEMBOLUS** and **INTUBATION** are associated with **SHUNT**, a measure of intrapulmonary shunting.\n\n8. **ERRLOWOUTPUT** is an alarm that reflects low cardiac output and may directly affect **HRBP** (heart rate-blood pressure relationship).\n\n9. **ERRCAUTER** is an equipment error that affects **HREKG** and **HRSAT**.\n\n10. **HISTORY** is a root node that may influence **HYPOVOLEMIA**, **LVFAILURE**, and **LVFAILURE**, as patient history informs the likelihood of these conditions.\n\n11. **MINVOLSET** (minimum volume setting) is a parameter in ventilator settings and may influence **MINVOL** (minimum volume).\n\n12. **VENTALV** (ventilator alarm valve) is a downstream node that may be influenced by **VENTTUBE** and **VENTLUNG**.\n\n13. **ARTCO2** and **EXPCO2** are both measures of carbon dioxide levels in the blood and are influenced by ventilation and perfusion.\n\n14. **HRBP**, **HREKG**, and **HRSAT** are derived from **HR** and **BP** and are influenced by alarms and system errors.\n\n15. **PRESS** (pressure) is a downstream node influenced by **KINKEDTUBE** and **DISCONNECT**.\n\nI ensure the graph is acyclic by not creating any feedback loops, and I avoid indirect relationships by only including direct causal links. This structure reflects a logical and physiologically grounded initial hypothesis for the alarm domain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180514.5157882132\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

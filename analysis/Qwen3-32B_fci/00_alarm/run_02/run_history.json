The goal is to identify direct causal relationships that align with domain knowledge and avoid cycles to ensure the graph is a DAG.\n\n1. **HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE** are root causes of reduced cardiac output and volume status. Both directly affect **LVEDVOLUME** and **STROKEVOLUME**, which are downstream indicators of cardiac function.\n\n2. **LVEDVOLUME** is a direct determinant of **CVP** and **PCWP**, as it influences venous return and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.\n\n3. **STROKEVOLUME** is a primary determinant of **CO** (cardiac output), which in turn affects **BP** (blood pressure) and **HR** (heart rate) in response to changes in output.\n\n4. **TPR** (total peripheral resistance) is influenced by **CATECHOL** (catecholamine use), which is often used to increase vascular tone and support BP.\n\n5. **FIO2** (fraction of inspired oxygen) directly influences **PVSAT** (pulmonary venous saturation) and indirectly **SAO2** (oxygen saturation in arterial blood), as higher oxygen delivery increases arterial oxygen levels.\n\n6. **VENTMACH** (ventilator use) and **INTUBATION** are mechanical interventions that influence **VENTTUBE** (ventilator tubing) and **VENTLUNG** (ventilator-lung interaction). **KINKEDTUBE** and **DISCONNECT** are common ventilator malfunctions that affect **PRESS** (pressure).\n\n7. **PULMEMBOLUS** and **INTUBATION** are associated with **SHUNT**, a measure of intrapulmonary shunting.\n\n8. **ERRLOWOUTPUT** is an alarm that reflects low cardiac output and may directly affect **HRBP** (heart rate-blood pressure relationship).\n\n9. **ERRCAUTER** is an equipment error that affects **HREKG** and **HRSAT**.\n\n10. **HISTORY** is a root node that may influence **HYPOVOLEMIA**, **LVFAILURE**, and **LVFAILURE**, as patient history informs the likelihood of these conditions.\n\n11. **MINVOLSET** (minimum volume setting) is a parameter in ventilator settings and may influence **MINVOL** (minimum volume).\n\n12. **VENTALV** (ventilator alarm valve) is a downstream node that may be influenced by **VENTTUBE** and **VENTLUNG**.\n\n13. **ARTCO2** and **EXPCO2** are both measures of carbon dioxide levels in the blood and are influenced by ventilation and perfusion.\n\n14. **HRBP**, **HREKG**, and **HRSAT** are derived from **HR** and **BP** and are influenced by alarms and system errors.\n\n15. **PRESS** (pressure) is a downstream node influenced by **KINKEDTUBE** and **DISCONNECT**.\n\nI ensure the graph is acyclic by not creating any feedback loops, and I avoid indirect relationships by only including direct causal links.

It is more plausible that HR (heart rate) and SAO2 (oxygen saturation) influence HRSAT rather than direct equipment errors.

However, the current graph includes an edge from ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG, which is valid and plausible. Instead of focusing on previously failed operations, we consider adding a new edge that better reflects the impact of ERRCAUTER on heart rate measurements. Specifically, ERRCAUTER can interfere with the EKG signal and potentially impact HRSAT (heart rate saturation), which is a derived variable from EKG and oxygen saturation. Adding an edge from ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT may better reflect the indirect influence of equipment errors on derived HR measurements.",

ERRCAUTER (electrosurgical cautery error) is known to interfere with ECG signals, which are used to derive HREKG (heart rate from EKG). However, the current graph includes an edge from ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG, which is valid and plausible. Instead of focusing on previously failed operations, we consider adding a new edge that better reflects the impact of ERRCAUTER on heart rate measurements. Specifically, ERRCAUTER can interfere with the EKG signal and potentially impact HRSAT (heart rate saturation), which is a derived variable from EKG and oxygen saturation.

However, based on domain knowledge, HRSAT (heart rate saturation) is more likely to be a derived or monitored variable that is affected by other physiological or alarm states, not directly caused by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. It is more plausible that HR (heart rate) and SAO2 (oxygen saturation) influence HRSAT rather than direct equipment errors. Therefore, the edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT is likely spurious or indirect and should be removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180300.66209641044\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -180312.9472, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRSAT')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180315.3886, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HR')]\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HREKG')]\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

It is more plausible that a faulty EKG signal (ERRCAUTER) could lead to an unreliable or missing HREKG reading, rather than HREKG causing the error. However, reversing or deleting this edge has previously failed, suggesting structural or likelihood constraints. Instead of modifying this edge, we consider adding a more plausible and direct relationship that aligns with domain knowledge and improves the graph\u2019s representational accuracy. Specifically, we propose adding a causal edge from ERRCAUTER to HRBP, as HRBP (blood pressure-based heart rate) could be affected by EKG errors that indirectly impact other HR measurements or trigger system alerts.",

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

ERRCAUTER is an equipment-related error, while HREKG is a physiological signal. It is more plausible that a faulty EKG signal (ERRCAUTER) could lead to an unreliable or missing HREKG reading, rather than HREKG causing the error. However, reversing or deleting this edge has previously failed, suggesting structural or likelihood constraints. Instead of modifying this edge, we consider adding a more plausible and direct relationship that aligns with domain knowledge and improves the graph\u2019s representational accuracy.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 19: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -180579.7418, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -180334.9806, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'ERRCAUTER', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: DELETE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 19: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 20: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations;

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations;

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations;

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations;

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: ERRCAUTER\u2192HRBP, ERRCAUTER\u2192HRBP, ERRCAUTER\u2192HRBP; DELETE: HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER; REVERSE: HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER, HREKG\u2192ERRCAUTER\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

          "llm_response": "{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"The current graph includes an edge from HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER, which is likely a spurious or reverse-causal relationship. ERRCAUTER represents an equipment error (e.g., cauterization error), while HREKG is a measured physiological signal. It is more plausible that ERRCAUTER indirectly affects HREKG by degrading signal quality or causing measurement artifacts. Thus, reversing the edge to ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG is not valid due to previous failures, but we hypothesize that ERRCAUTER could influence an intermediate variable like HRBP (blood pressure-derived heart rate), which is more likely to be impacted by measurement errors or system malfunctions.

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations;

While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -180300.6621, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'HREKG', 'ERRCAUTER')]\nAttempt 2: REVERSE operation failed: edge HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER or ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG not in valid operations;

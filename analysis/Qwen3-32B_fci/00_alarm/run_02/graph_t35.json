    "reasoning": "Based on the interventional evidence, the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME has been repeatedly attempted for deletion but failed due to the lack of sufficient conditional support. However, we have evidence that do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME significantly (TVD=0.1756), and when conditioning on LVEDVOLUME, the effect is still significant (avg_TVD=0.1979), which supports a direct causal link. Therefore, instead of deleting the edge, we should consider whether the current structure is missing an intermediate variable or if the edge is necessary. Since the edge already exists and the interventional evidence supports it, no deletion is warranted. Similarly, for TPR \u2192 HRBP, the interventional evidence consistently shows no significant effect, and the edge should be deleted. However, due to previous failed attempts, we must ensure the edge is present in the current graph before attempting deletion. Since the edge is not in the current graph, it cannot be deleted. For LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP, the interventional evidence shows a significant effect even after conditioning, so deletion is not supported. Therefore, the only valid and supported operation is to DELETE the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME, but due to previous failures and insufficient conditional support, this operation is not feasible. The most viable and supported operation is to DELETE the edge TPR \u2192 HRBP, as the interventional evidence consistently shows no significant effect, and it is not currently in the graph, so we cannot perform the operation. Hence, no operation is proposed.",

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, TPR\u2192HRBP, LVFAILURE\u2192CVP, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, TPR\u2192HRBP, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, TPR\u2192HRBP, TPR\u2192HRBP, TPR\u2192HRBP, TPR\u2192HRBP, TPR\u2192HRBP, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, TPR\u2192HRBP, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, TPR\u2192HRBP, TPR\u2192HRBP, LVFAILURE\u2192CVP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

      "llm_response": "{\n  \"overall_reasoning\": \"Based on the interventional evidence, the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME has been repeatedly attempted for deletion but failed due to the lack of sufficient conditional support. However, we have evidence that do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME significantly (TVD=0.1756), and when conditioning on LVEDVOLUME, the effect is still significant (avg_TVD=0.1979), which supports a direct causal link. Therefore, instead of deleting the edge, we should consider whether the current structure is missing an intermediate variable or if the edge is necessary. Since the edge already exists and the interventional evidence supports it, no deletion is warranted. Similarly, for TPR \u2192 HRBP, the interventional evidence consistently shows no significant effect, and the edge should be deleted. However, due to previous failed attempts, we must ensure the edge is present in the current graph before attempting deletion. Since the edge is not in the current graph, it cannot be deleted. For LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP, the interventional evidence shows a significant effect even after conditioning, so deletion is not supported. Therefore, the only valid and supported operation is to DELETE the edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME, but due to previous failures and insufficient conditional support, this operation is not feasible. The most viable and supported operation is to DELETE the edge TPR \u2192 HRBP, as the interventional evidence consistently shows no significant effect, and it is not currently in the graph, so we cannot perform the operation. Hence, no operation is proposed.\",\n  \"confirmed_edges\": [\"HYPOVOLEMIA -> BP\"],\n  \"edge_notes\": {\n    \"HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\": \"The interventional evidence supports a direct effect, but the effect is likely mediated by LVEDVOLUME.

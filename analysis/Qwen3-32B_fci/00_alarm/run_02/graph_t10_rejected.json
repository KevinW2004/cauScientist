While previous attempts to delete this edge failed, it is plausible that this relationship is spurious or indirect. HREKG (heart rate from EKG) is primarily a physiological signal influenced by cardiac and hemodynamic states, not by equipment errors like ERRCAUTER. Instead, equipment errors like ERRCAUTER may influence the reliability or accuracy of HR measurements (e.g., HRSAT or HRBP), not directly cause them. A more plausible relationship is that ERRCAUTER affects the quality or availability of EKG data, which in turn may indirectly impact the derivation of HREKG. Therefore, we will test reversing the edge to examine whether HREKG could influence ERRCAUTER (e.g., through error detection or system feedback).\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - DISCONNECT -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTTUBE -> VENTALV\n  - VENTLUNG -> VENTALV\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  HREKG \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -180289.35151901786\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

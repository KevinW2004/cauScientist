The tentative notes suggest that certain indirect causal relationships (e.g., HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT) are already well-supported and do not require further testing. However, the direct effect of LVFAILURE on HR is supported by interventional evidence, which is important for maintaining a realistic and accurate model. We propose the following candidate operations and experiments to refine the causal graph:\n\n1. **Add LVFAILURE \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT**: While the tentative note suggests that the effect is fully mediated through STROKEVOLUME and CO, adding a direct edge could capture residual or non-linear effects, especially if interventional data shows a significant direct impact.\n\n2. **Add HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT**: Similar to LVFAILURE, the tentative note suggests mediation, but adding a direct edge could help in capturing additional pathways or unobserved confounding.\n\n3. **Add LVFAILURE \u2192 ERRCAUTER**: This is a speculative addition based on domain knowledge suggesting that left ventricular failure might lead to increased cauterization errors due to hemodynamic instability. This could be validated by an interventional study.\n\nFor each candidate operation, we design a targeted experiment to test the direct causal effect.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> PCWP\n  - CVP -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - LVFAILURE -> PAP\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOL -> VENTALV\n  - MINVOLSET -> VENTALV\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> EXPCO2\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CO\n  - LVFAILURE -> CO\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> BP\n  - LVFAILURE -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - PRESS -> BP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: Although the effect is likely mediated through STROKEVOLUME and CO, interventional evidence may reveal a direct influence, especially in the presence of strong LV failure.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT (Reasoning: Hypovolemia can lead to low cardiac output and subsequent low output alarms. While mediated through CO and STROKEVOLUME, a direct effect may still exist and should be tested.)\n3.

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, from a domain perspective, `HRBP` represents an alarm or signal that is more likely to be triggered by a combination of `HR` (heart rate) and `BP` (blood pressure), rather than solely by `BP`. Since `HR` is already a parent of `HRBP`, and `BP` may influence `HR` indirectly (e.g., via compensatory mechanisms), it is plausible that `BP` does not directly cause `HRBP`. Removing this edge would better reflect the indirect and mediated role of `BP` in the alarm generation process.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  MINVOL \u2192 PRESS\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 SAO2\n  PAP \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 EXPCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  CO \u2192 HR\n  BP \u2192 HR\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -176643.28214428728\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -176925.9738, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'HR')]\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 HR or HR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -176658.4092, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'BP', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 HR or HR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

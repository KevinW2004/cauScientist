        "reasoning": "The alarm domain involves a complex interplay of physiological and mechanical variables in a clinical setting, particularly in intensive care or anesthesia. My reasoning begins by identifying the root causes of physiological conditions and mechanical states, and how they influence downstream variables. For example, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both root causes of LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, as they directly affect cardiac volume and output. LVFAILURE is a chronic or pathological condition, while HYPOVOLEMIA is often acute. LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are intermediate variables that affect CO and BP. CVP and PCWP are indicators of fluid status and left/right ventricular pressures, respectively, and are influenced by LVEDVOLUME and LVFAILURE. TPR (total peripheral resistance) is influenced by CATECHOL (catecholamine levels), which in turn affects BP. ERRLOWOUTPUT is a monitoring error that may influence HRBP. ERRCAUTER is a sensor error that affects HREKG and HRSAT. FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) directly affects PVSAT (pulmonary venous saturation). Mechanical issues like KINKEDTUBE, DISCONNECT, and INTUBATION are root causes of specific device or ventilation-related variables like PRESS and SHUNT. VENTMACH and VENTALV are mechanical components that influence VENTTUBE. VENTLUNG is affected by INTUBATION. CO (cardiac output) is influenced by STROKEVOLUME and HR. HR is influenced by HREKG, HRSAT, and HRBP. BP is influenced by CO and TPR. CO2-related variables (ARTCO2, EXPCO2) are influenced by ventilation and perfusion. Anaphylaxis and INSUFFANESTH are potential root causes of acute hemodynamic and respiratory changes. The relationships are chosen to reflect direct, immediate causal effects and to avoid cycles by ensuring all arrows point toward downstream effects. Only the most direct and well-supported relationships are included based on domain knowledge and the FCI algorithm's suggestions.",

My reasoning begins by identifying the root causes of physiological conditions and mechanical states, and how they influence downstream variables. For example, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both root causes of LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, as they directly affect cardiac volume and output. LVFAILURE is a chronic or pathological condition, while HYPOVOLEMIA is often acute. LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are intermediate variables that affect CO and BP. CVP and PCWP are indicators of fluid status and left/right ventricular pressures, respectively, and are influenced by LVEDVOLUME and LVFAILURE. TPR (total peripheral resistance) is influenced by CATECHOL (catecholamine levels), which in turn affects BP. ERRLOWOUTPUT is a monitoring error that may influence HRBP. ERRCAUTER is a sensor error that affects HREKG and HRSAT. FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) directly affects PVSAT (pulmonary venous saturation). Mechanical issues like KINKEDTUBE, DISCONNECT, and INTUBATION are root causes of specific device or ventilation-related variables like PRESS and SHUNT. VENTMACH and VENTALV are mechanical components that influence VENTTUBE. VENTLUNG is affected by INTUBATION. CO (cardiac output) is influenced by STROKEVOLUME and HR. HR is influenced by HREKG, HRSAT, and HRBP. BP is influenced by CO and TPR. CO2-related variables (ARTCO2, EXPCO2) are influenced by ventilation and perfusion. Anaphylaxis and INSUFFANESTH are potential root causes of acute hemodynamic and respiratory changes. The relationships are chosen to reflect direct, immediate causal effects and to avoid cycles by ensuring all arrows point toward downstream effects. Only the most direct and well-supported relationships are included based on domain knowledge and the FCI algorithm's suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179257.2665811022\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

My reasoning begins by identifying the root causes of physiological conditions and mechanical states, and how they influence downstream variables. For example, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both root causes of LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, as they directly affect cardiac volume and output. LVFAILURE is a chronic or pathological condition, while HYPOVOLEMIA is often acute. LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are intermediate variables that affect CO and BP. CVP and PCWP are indicators of fluid status and left/right ventricular pressures, respectively, and are influenced by LVEDVOLUME and LVFAILURE. TPR (total peripheral resistance) is influenced by CATECHOL (catecholamine levels), which in turn affects BP. ERRLOWOUTPUT is a monitoring error that may influence HRBP. ERRCAUTER is a sensor error that affects HREKG and HRSAT. FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) directly affects PVSAT (pulmonary venous saturation). Mechanical issues like KINKEDTUBE, DISCONNECT, and INTUBATION are root causes of specific device or ventilation-related variables like PRESS and SHUNT. VENTMACH and VENTALV are mechanical components that influence VENTTUBE. VENTLUNG is affected by INTUBATION. CO (cardiac output) is influenced by STROKEVOLUME and HR. HR is influenced by HREKG, HRSAT, and HRBP. BP is influenced by CO and TPR. CO2-related variables (ARTCO2, EXPCO2) are influenced by ventilation and perfusion. Anaphylaxis and INSUFFANESTH are potential root causes of acute hemodynamic and respiratory changes. The relationships are chosen to reflect direct, immediate causal effects and to avoid cycles by ensuring all arrows point toward downstream effects. Only the most direct and well-supported relationships are included based on domain knowledge and the FCI algorithm's suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179257.2665811022\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -183932.1156, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'PVSAT', 'SAO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

While LVFAILURE is a known cause of elevated PCWP, LVEDVOLUME is a more direct and immediate determinant of PCWP. This suggests that LVFAILURE may influence PCWP indirectly through LVEDVOLUME.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

          "llm_response": "{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"The current graph includes the edge LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP, which is physiologically plausible since left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDVOLUME) directly influences pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). However, the relationship between PCWP and LVFAILURE is still under consideration. Since LVFAILURE affects LVEDVOLUME, and LVEDVOLUME affects PCWP, LVFAILURE may influence PCWP indirectly through LVEDVOLUME. To explore this, reversing the edge PCWP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME could help test if PCWP is a downstream indicator of LVEDVOLUME rather than a direct cause. This would better align with the physiological understanding that increased LVEDVOLUME leads to elevated PCWP, rather than the other way around.\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\", \"LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\", \"HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\", \"LVFAILURE -> CVP\", \"HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\", \"LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\", \"LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\", \"CATECHOL -> TPR\", \"PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\", \"INTUBATION -> SHUNT\", \"DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\", \"VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\", \"KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\", \"INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\", \"MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\", \"FIO2 -> PVSAT\", \"PVSAT -> SAO2\", \"VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\", \"CO -> ARTCO2\", \"ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\", \"LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\", \"ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\", \"HREKG -> HR\", \"HRSAT -> HR\", \"HRBP -> HR\", \"ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\", \"ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\", \"ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\", \"STROKEVOLUME -> CO\", \"HR -> CO\", \"CO -> BP\", \"TPR -> BP\", \"LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"LVFAILURE -> PCWP\": \"LVFAILURE may influence PCWP indirectly through LVEDVOLUME rather than directly; this edge may be redundant\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"PCWP\",\n    \"child\": \"LVEDVOLUME\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"PCWP is more likely a downstream effect of LVEDVOLUME rather than a cause.

While LVFAILURE is a known cause of elevated PCWP, LVEDVOLUME is a more direct and immediate determinant of PCWP. This suggests that LVFAILURE may influence PCWP indirectly through LVEDVOLUME. Removing the direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge may improve the graph's log-likelihood by eliminating a redundant path and aligning it more closely with a direct physiological mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 2):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179211.00808748102\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -183203.0231, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LVEDVOLUME', 'PCWP')]\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge PCWP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME or LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180350.8170, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

While LVFAILURE is a known cause of elevated PCWP, LVEDVOLUME is a more direct and immediate determinant of PCWP. This suggests that LVFAILURE may influence PCWP indirectly through LVEDVOLUME. Removing the direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge may improve the graph's log-likelihood by eliminating a redundant path and aligning it more closely with a direct physiological mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 2):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179211.00808748102\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -183203.0231, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LVEDVOLUME', 'PCWP')]\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge PCWP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME or LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180350.8170, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: ADD operation failed: edge PCWP \u2192 LVFAILURE not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: LL too low: -179257.2666, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LVFAILURE', 'PCWP')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the reverse relationship\u2014BP \u2192 TPR\u2014has been previously attempted without success, suggesting that the causal influence may not be symmetric. A more strategic refinement is to consider whether BP could indirectly influence TPR through regulatory mechanisms (e.g., baroreceptor feedback), rather than reversing the edge outright. Instead of reversing the edge, we propose adding a reverse influence in the form of a new edge BP \u2192 TPR to better capture the bidirectional regulatory relationship that may exist in the body's hemodynamic control system. This addition would allow the model to account for feedback loops while preserving the existing structure and avoiding redundancy.\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"TPR -> BP\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"BP -> TPR\": \"Tentative: Consider testing for regulatory feedback from BP to TPR via baroreceptor mechanisms or other homeostatic control systems.\"}, \n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"BP\",\n    \"child\": \"TPR\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Blood pressure can influence systemic vascular resistance through feedback mechanisms such as the baroreceptor reflex.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 BP or BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -180217.1726, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'CVP')]\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 14: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 BP or BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 18: REVERSE operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations;

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: BP\u2192TPR; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192PCWP, LVFAILURE\u2192CVP; REVERSE: BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192BP, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations;

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations;

However, the indirect influence of LVFAILURE on PCWP via LVEDVOLUME may be overrepresented by retaining a direct LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP edge. Removing this direct edge may reduce redundancy and improve the graph's log-likelihood, provided it does not disrupt other valid paths or relationships. Given the previous failed attempts to modify this edge, a more strategic local refinement is required. A plausible and untested option is to examine whether the reverse of the edge TPR \u2192 BP may improve the model by better reflecting the complex interplay between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - LVFAILURE -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - CATECHOL -> TPR\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - CO -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - LVFAILURE -> CATECHOL\n  - ANAPHYLAXIS -> CATECHOL\n  - HREKG -> HR\n  - HRSAT -> HR\n  - HRBP -> HR\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HR -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179077.34462147715\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -179211.0081, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'BP', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations;

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: BP\u2192TPR; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192PCWP, LVFAILURE\u2192CVP, LVFAILURE\u2192PCWP; REVERSE: BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192BP, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR, BP\u2192TPR\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

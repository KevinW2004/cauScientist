Each of these edges was previously considered but constrained by model fit or indirect explanations. To verify, targeted interventional experiments are proposed that isolate the treatment variable from confounding influences by conditioning on relevant variables.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 CO\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 BP\n  - CO \u2192 HR\n  - BP \u2192 HR\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE \u2192 PAP\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 HR (Reasoning: Evidence suggests a direct effect of LVFAILURE on HR when conditioning on CO and BP. This direct path may reflect a physiological mechanism not captured by the indirect path through CO and BP alone.)\n2. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: Interventional evidence (TVD=0.3687) supports a direct causal effect of LVFAILURE on CO. Adding this edge ensures the graph reflects this causal mechanism, even if CO is influenced indirectly by other variables.)\n3. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Interventional evidence (TVD=0.2689) supports a direct causal effect of LVFAILURE on BP. Given that BP is influenced by CO and TPR, but not all effects are captured by these, a direct edge from LVFAILURE to BP may be necessary.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME (TVD=0.1756).

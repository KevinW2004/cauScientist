Since no conditioning was possible, we cannot determine if this is a direct or indirect relationship. To resolve this, we need to perform an interventional experiment to test if the influence of ERRLOWOUTPUT on HRBP is direct. If the intervention shows no significant change in HRBP after conditioning on relevant variables, the link may be indirect or spurious and should be removed.\n\nAdditionally, the tentative note on VENTALV \u2192 VENTTUBE is not supported by significant interventional evidence when conditioning on VENTMACH. The current graph already has a strong link from VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE, and VENTALV's effect is likely mediated through VENTMACH. Thus, this link should be deleted to preserve DAG acyclicity and avoid overfitting.\n\nFinally, we consider whether the link from HYPOVOLEMIA to LVEDVOLUME is direct or if it is mediated through another variable like STROKEVOLUME or CVP. This would help refine the causal structure and improve the graph's accuracy.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: VENTALV \u2192 VENTTUBE (Reasoning: The interventional evidence shows no significant direct effect of VENTALV on VENTTUBE when conditioning on VENTMACH. The current graph already has VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE, and VENTALV's influence is likely indirect and mediated by VENTMACH.)\n2. DELETE: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: The causal link from ERRLOWOUTPUT to HRBP is marginal and lacks conditioning evidence. We need to verify whether this is a direct or spurious link via an interventional experiment.)\n3. REVERSE: LVEDVOLUME \u2192 HYPOVOLEMIA (Reasoning: We suspect that the relationship between HYPOVOLEMIA and LVEDVOLUME may not be strictly unidirectional. Reversing this edge would help determine if LVEDVOLUME is a cause or a consequence of HYPOVOLEMIA, especially in the context of other mediators like STROKEVOLUME.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME (TVD=0.1756).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

My reasoning begins by identifying the root causes of physiological conditions and mechanical states, and how they influence downstream variables. For example, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both root causes of LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, as they directly affect cardiac volume and output. LVFAILURE is a chronic or pathological condition, while HYPOVOLEMIA is often acute. LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are intermediate variables that affect CO and BP. CVP and PCWP are indicators of fluid status and left/right ventricular pressures, respectively, and are influenced by LVEDVOLUME and LVFAILURE. TPR (total peripheral resistance) is influenced by CATECHOL (catecholamine levels), which in turn affects BP. ERRLOWOUTPUT is a monitoring error that may influence HRBP. ERRCAUTER is a sensor error that affects HREKG and HRSAT. FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) directly affects PVSAT (pulmonary venous saturation). Mechanical issues like KINKEDTUBE, DISCONNECT, and INTUBATION are root causes of specific device or ventilation-related variables like PRESS and SHUNT. VENTMACH and VENTALV are mechanical components that influence VENTTUBE. VENTLUNG is affected by INTUBATION. CO (cardiac output) is influenced by STROKEVOLUME and HR. HR is influenced by HREKG, HRSAT, and HRBP. BP is influenced by CO and TPR. CO2-related variables (ARTCO2, EXPCO2) are influenced by ventilation and perfusion. Anaphylaxis and INSUFFANESTH are potential root causes of acute hemodynamic and respiratory changes. The relationships are chosen to reflect direct, immediate causal effects and to avoid cycles by ensuring all arrows point toward downstream effects. Only the most direct and well-supported relationships are included based on domain knowledge and the FCI algorithm's suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -179257.2665811022\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

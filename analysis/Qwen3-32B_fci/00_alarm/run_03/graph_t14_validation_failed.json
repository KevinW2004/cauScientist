While LVFAILURE influences HR indirectly via CO and BP, the marginal do(LVFAILURE) \u2192 HR is not significant, but becomes significant when conditioned on CO and BP. This suggests that the relationship might not be direct, or that there is a confounding structure that needs clarification. To improve the graph, we should investigate whether the LVFAILURE \u2192 HR edge is spurious or real. Additionally, we should consider the possibility of a direct effect of LVFAILURE on BP, as BP is influenced by CO and TPR, and LVFAILURE affects CO. Lastly, we should verify if the current structure of HR being influenced by BP and CO is sufficient or if additional influences exist.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 HR (Reasoning: The evidence for a direct effect of LVFAILURE on HR is conflicting. Since HR is already influenced by BP and CO, which are affected by LVFAILURE, the direct edge may be redundant or spurious.)\n2. ADD: LVFAILURE \u2192 BP (Reasoning: LVFAILURE affects CO, which in turn affects BP. However, BP is also affected by TPR. There is a possibility that LVFAILURE has a direct effect on BP, which could explain some of its influence on HR through BP.)\n3. ADD: ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 CO (Reasoning: ERRLOWOUTPUT is currently only influencing HR and HRBP, but it is a system-level error that may also affect cardiac output (CO) directly. Adding this edge would make the error's influence on the cardiovascular system more explicit.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME (TVD=0.1756).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

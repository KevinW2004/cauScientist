While the current graph includes TPR \u2192 BP, CO is a major determinant of BP through the equation BP \u2248 CO \u00d7 TPR. Therefore, adding a direct edge from CO to BP would better capture the causal mechanism of how cardiac output influences blood pressure, improving the model's structure and log-likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTALV -> PRESS\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 14):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PAP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  VENTALV \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HR\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -166021.25712758067\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -170221.7814, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'TPR', 'BP')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CO \u2192 HR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

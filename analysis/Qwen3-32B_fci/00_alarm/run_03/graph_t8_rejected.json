Given the clinical plausibility of hypovolemia affecting central venous pressure, I will attempt to add another edge that supports this causal pathway indirectly. A plausible candidate is adding LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP, as left ventricular failure can lead to elevated venous pressures due to impaired cardiac output and backward failure. This addition is consistent with domain knowledge and may improve the graph\u2019s causal coherence without repeating previous failed attempts.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 7):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -184487.66211477673\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

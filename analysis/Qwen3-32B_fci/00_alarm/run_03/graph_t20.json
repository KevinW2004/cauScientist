Since this edge is not valid for addition, we must consider alternative local refinements. Upon analysis, the relationship between CO and HRBP is notable. HRBP is a derived variable that reflects the interaction between heart rate and blood pressure, and CO is a key determinant of BP. It is plausible that CO has a direct influence on HRBP, as changes in cardiac output can affect the heart rate-blood pressure relationship monitored by HRBP. Adding CO \u2192 HRBP is a local, plausible refinement that aligns with hemodynamic principles and may improve the model's structure and likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTALV -> PRESS\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 19):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PAP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  VENTALV \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  CO \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HR\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  BP \u2192 HRBP\n  CO \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -164300.01763685443\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

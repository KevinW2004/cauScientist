    "reasoning": "The alarm domain involves a complex interplay of physiological and mechanical variables in a clinical setting, particularly in intensive care or anesthesia. My reasoning begins by identifying the root causes of physiological conditions and mechanical states, and how they influence downstream variables. For example, HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both root causes of LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME, as they directly affect cardiac volume and output. LVFAILURE is a chronic or pathological condition, while HYPOVOLEMIA is often acute. LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are intermediate variables that affect CO and BP. CVP and PCWP are indicators of fluid status and left/right ventricular pressures, respectively, and are influenced by LVEDVOLUME and LVFAILURE. TPR (total peripheral resistance) is influenced by CATECHOL (catecholamine levels), which in turn affects BP. ERRLOWOUTPUT is a monitoring error that may influence HRBP. ERRCAUTER is a sensor error that affects HREKG and HRSAT. FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) directly affects PVSAT (pulmonary venous saturation). Mechanical issues like KINKEDTUBE, DISCONNECT, and INTUBATION are root causes of specific device or ventilation-related variables like PRESS and SHUNT. VENTMACH and VENTALV are mechanical components that influence VENTTUBE. VENTLUNG is affected by INTUBATION. CO (cardiac output) is influenced by STROKEVOLUME and HR. HR is influenced by HREKG, HRSAT, and HRBP. BP is influenced by CO and TPR. CO2-related variables (ARTCO2, EXPCO2) are influenced by ventilation and perfusion. Anaphylaxis and INSUFFANESTH are potential root causes of acute hemodynamic and respiratory changes. The relationships are chosen to reflect direct, immediate causal effects and to avoid cycles by ensuring all arrows point toward downstream effects. Only the most direct and well-supported relationships are included based on domain knowledge and the FCI algorithm's suggestions.",

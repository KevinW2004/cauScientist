However, prior attempts to delete or reverse this edge have failed, suggesting it is either not in the graph or not allowed by the current search space. Instead of focusing on TPR \u2192 CO, we should explore other relationships that might be more directly impacted by domain knowledge and interventional logic. One such candidate is the relationship between MINVOL and PRESS. While prior attempts to add MINVOL \u2192 PRESS failed, it may still be a plausible causal link given that minute volume settings in ventilators can influence pressure measurements. A reversal of an existing edge might also be worth testing to uncover a more plausible causal direction.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - TPR -> BP\n  - CO -> BP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CO\n  - LVFAILURE -> CO\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> HR\n  - LVFAILURE -> HR\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - VENTALV -> ARTCO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> ARTCO2\n  - VENTALV -> EXPCO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> EXPCO2\n  - MINVOLSET -> VENTALV\n  - MINVOL -> VENTALV\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - VENTALV -> VENTLUNG\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - VENTTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 21):\n  HISTORY \u2192 HYPOVOLEMIA\n  HISTORY \u2192 LVFAILURE\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  TPR \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CO\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 HR\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  PRESS \u2192 KINKEDTUBE\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 EXPCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTALV\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  VENTALV \u2192 VENTLUNG\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -178374.68010981183\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

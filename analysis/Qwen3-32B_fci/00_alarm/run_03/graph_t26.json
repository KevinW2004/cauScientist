Since this edge is already present, the focus should shift to evaluating other potential refinements that are grounded in physiological plausibility and do not violate the DAG constraint. One such candidate is the relationship between LVFAILURE and PCWP. Left ventricular failure is known to increase PCWP due to increased left-sided filling pressures. Therefore, adding a direct edge from LVFAILURE to PCWP is a local, physiology-based refinement that may improve the model's accuracy.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CVP\n  - MINVOL -> VENTALV\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> PCWP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 18):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -176532.11641685307\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -176545.2598, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'LVFAILURE', 'PAP')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -176656.6804, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'TPR', 'PCWP')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PAP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PAP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -177629.9065, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LVFAILURE', 'PCWP')]\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: LVFAILURE\u2192PAP, TPR\u2192PCWP, LVFAILURE\u2192PAP, LVFAILURE\u2192PAP, LVFAILURE\u2192PCWP; DELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192PCWP, LVFAILURE\u2192PCWP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

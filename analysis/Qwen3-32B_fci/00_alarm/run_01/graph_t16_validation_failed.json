Since the tentative notes suggest that TPR may influence BP indirectly via HYPOVOLEMIA or STROKEVOLUME, it is possible that the direct edge TPR \u2192 BP should be removed or replaced. Additionally, I will check the robustness of the ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT edge to confirm its directness through intervention.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: The tentative note suggests that the TPR \u2192 BP relationship might be indirect or confounded by HYPOVOLEMIA or STROKEVOLUME. Removing this edge could improve the graph by forcing a more accurate representation of the causal pathways.)\n2. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA is already connected to BP, but the tentative note implies that BP might be more directly influenced by HYPOVOLEMIA than by TPR. Adding a direct edge could reinforce the causal pathway from HYPOVOLEMIA to BP.)\n3. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP (Reasoning: STROKEVOLUME is connected to BP, and the tentative note suggests that BP might be influenced by STROKEVOLUME more directly than via TPR. Adding a direct edge could clarify the causal influence of stroke volume on blood pressure.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CVP (TVD=0.0840).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

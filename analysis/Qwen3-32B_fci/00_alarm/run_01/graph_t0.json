The goal is to map how these variables interact in a logical, acyclic manner that aligns with clinical and physiological understanding.\n\n1. **Underlying Conditions**: Variables like HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are root causes that directly affect hemodynamic parameters like LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. These represent baseline physiological conditions that can be worsened by interventions or disease progression.\n\n2. **Derived Physiological Variables**: Variables such as LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are downstream of HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE and feed into higher-level metrics like CO (Cardiac Output) and BP (Blood Pressure). These variables are also influenced by TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance), which in turn can be modulated by CATECHOL (Catecholamine use).\n\n3. **Interventions and Equipment**: Variables like VENTTUBE, VENTMACH, and PRESS are influenced by interventions like INTUBATION and equipment states like KINKEDTUBE. These interventions can lead to secondary effects such as VENTLUNG and SHUNT.\n\n4. **Alarm Triggers**: Variables like ERRLOWOUTPUT and ERRCAUTER are alarm signals that are triggered by physiological changes and can affect monitoring systems like HRBP, HREKG, and HRSAT.\n\n5. **Gas Exchange and Monitoring**: FIO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen) influences PVSAT (Pulmonary Vascular Saturation), and gas exchange parameters like PAP (Pulmonary Arterial Pressure) and PULMEMBOLUS influence SHUNT. Monitoring variables such as SAO2 (SpO2) and EXPCO2 (End-tidal CO2) are downstream of these.\n\n6. **Temporal and Causal Order**: I ensure that all relationships are direct and acyclic, with root causes at the top and effects downstream. For example, MINVOLSET (Minute Volume Setting) influences MINVOL (Minute Volume), which in turn affects VENTALV (Ventilator Alarm Value) and VENTLUNG.\n\nBy applying domain knowledge of cardiovascular and respiratory physiology, and using the FCI algorithm as a guide, I construct a DAG that reflects plausible causal pathways in the alarm domain.",

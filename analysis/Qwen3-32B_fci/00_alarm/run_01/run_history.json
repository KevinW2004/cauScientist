The goal is to map how these variables interact in a logical, acyclic manner that aligns with clinical and physiological understanding.\n\n1. **Underlying Conditions**: Variables like HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are root causes that directly affect hemodynamic parameters like LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. These represent baseline physiological conditions that can be worsened by interventions or disease progression.\n\n2. **Derived Physiological Variables**: Variables such as LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are downstream of HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE and feed into higher-level metrics like CO (Cardiac Output) and BP (Blood Pressure). These variables are also influenced by TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance), which in turn can be modulated by CATECHOL (Catecholamine use).\n\n3. **Interventions and Equipment**: Variables like VENTTUBE, VENTMACH, and PRESS are influenced by interventions like INTUBATION and equipment states like KINKEDTUBE. These interventions can lead to secondary effects such as VENTLUNG and SHUNT.\n\n4. **Alarm Triggers**: Variables like ERRLOWOUTPUT and ERRCAUTER are alarm signals that are triggered by physiological changes and can affect monitoring systems like HRBP, HREKG, and HRSAT.\n\n5. **Gas Exchange and Monitoring**: FIO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen) influences PVSAT (Pulmonary Vascular Saturation), and gas exchange parameters like PAP (Pulmonary Arterial Pressure) and PULMEMBOLUS influence SHUNT. Monitoring variables such as SAO2 (SpO2) and EXPCO2 (End-tidal CO2) are downstream of these.\n\n6. **Temporal and Causal Order**: I ensure that all relationships are direct and acyclic, with root causes at the top and effects downstream. For example, MINVOLSET (Minute Volume Setting) influences MINVOL (Minute Volume), which in turn affects VENTALV (Ventilator Alarm Value) and VENTLUNG.\n\nBy applying domain knowledge of cardiovascular and respiratory physiology, and using the FCI algorithm as a guide, I construct a DAG that reflects plausible causal pathways in the alarm domain.",

The goal is to map how these variables interact in a logical, acyclic manner that aligns with clinical and physiological understanding.\n\n1. **Underlying Conditions**: Variables like HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are root causes that directly affect hemodynamic parameters like LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. These represent baseline physiological conditions that can be worsened by interventions or disease progression.\n\n2. **Derived Physiological Variables**: Variables such as LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are downstream of HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE and feed into higher-level metrics like CO (Cardiac Output) and BP (Blood Pressure). These variables are also influenced by TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance), which in turn can be modulated by CATECHOL (Catecholamine use).\n\n3. **Interventions and Equipment**: Variables like VENTTUBE, VENTMACH, and PRESS are influenced by interventions like INTUBATION and equipment states like KINKEDTUBE. These interventions can lead to secondary effects such as VENTLUNG and SHUNT.\n\n4. **Alarm Triggers**: Variables like ERRLOWOUTPUT and ERRCAUTER are alarm signals that are triggered by physiological changes and can affect monitoring systems like HRBP, HREKG, and HRSAT.\n\n5. **Gas Exchange and Monitoring**: FIO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen) influences PVSAT (Pulmonary Vascular Saturation), and gas exchange parameters like PAP (Pulmonary Arterial Pressure) and PULMEMBOLUS influence SHUNT. Monitoring variables such as SAO2 (SpO2) and EXPCO2 (End-tidal CO2) are downstream of these.\n\n6. **Temporal and Causal Order**: I ensure that all relationships are direct and acyclic, with root causes at the top and effects downstream. For example, MINVOLSET (Minute Volume Setting) influences MINVOL (Minute Volume), which in turn affects VENTALV (Ventilator Alarm Value) and VENTLUNG.\n\nBy applying domain knowledge of cardiovascular and respiratory physiology, and using the FCI algorithm as a guide, I construct a DAG that reflects plausible causal pathways in the alarm domain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155757.15032907735\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

The goal is to map how these variables interact in a logical, acyclic manner that aligns with clinical and physiological understanding.\n\n1. **Underlying Conditions**: Variables like HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are root causes that directly affect hemodynamic parameters like LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. These represent baseline physiological conditions that can be worsened by interventions or disease progression.\n\n2. **Derived Physiological Variables**: Variables such as LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME are downstream of HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE and feed into higher-level metrics like CO (Cardiac Output) and BP (Blood Pressure). These variables are also influenced by TPR (Total Peripheral Resistance), which in turn can be modulated by CATECHOL (Catecholamine use).\n\n3. **Interventions and Equipment**: Variables like VENTTUBE, VENTMACH, and PRESS are influenced by interventions like INTUBATION and equipment states like KINKEDTUBE. These interventions can lead to secondary effects such as VENTLUNG and SHUNT.\n\n4. **Alarm Triggers**: Variables like ERRLOWOUTPUT and ERRCAUTER are alarm signals that are triggered by physiological changes and can affect monitoring systems like HRBP, HREKG, and HRSAT.\n\n5. **Gas Exchange and Monitoring**: FIO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen) influences PVSAT (Pulmonary Vascular Saturation), and gas exchange parameters like PAP (Pulmonary Arterial Pressure) and PULMEMBOLUS influence SHUNT. Monitoring variables such as SAO2 (SpO2) and EXPCO2 (End-tidal CO2) are downstream of these.\n\n6. **Temporal and Causal Order**: I ensure that all relationships are direct and acyclic, with root causes at the top and effects downstream. For example, MINVOLSET (Minute Volume Setting) influences MINVOL (Minute Volume), which in turn affects VENTALV (Ventilator Alarm Value) and VENTLUNG.\n\nBy applying domain knowledge of cardiovascular and respiratory physiology, and using the FCI algorithm as a guide, I construct a DAG that reflects plausible causal pathways in the alarm domain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155757.15032907735\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -156047.6713, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'TPR', 'CO')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: LVFAILURE\u2192LVEDVOLUME\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

However, a potential local refinement involves the relationship between CATECHOL and TPR. While CATECHOL is generally understood to increase TPR (vasoconstriction), in certain clinical contexts, such as during acute stress or shock, TPR might be more of a downstream indicator rather than a direct effect of CATECHOL.

However, based on physiological reasoning, CATECHOL (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine) typically acts on the vasculature to increase TPR through vasoconstriction. The current edge direction may be reversed due to a feedback or measurement artifact. A more plausible direction is CATECHOL \u2192 TPR.

However, the previous failed attempts to reverse this edge suggest that the model may not support such a reversal due to statistical or structural constraints. Instead of focusing on the TPR-CATECHOL edge, we should explore other local refinements that align with domain knowledge and are less likely to violate graph validity. One such candidate is the relationship between CO (cardiac output) and TPR. CO and TPR are interdependent hemodynamic variables that influence BP. While CO \u2192 BP and TPR \u2192 BP are already in the graph, CO and TPR may also influence each other. Adding a direct edge from CO to TPR could capture how changes in cardiac output may affect vascular tone and peripheral resistance as a compensatory mechanism.",

However, a potential local refinement involves the relationship between CATECHOL and TPR. While CATECHOL is generally understood to increase TPR (vasoconstriction), in certain clinical contexts, such as during acute stress or shock, TPR might be more of a downstream indicator rather than a direct effect of CATECHOL.

However, the previous failed attempts to reverse this edge suggest that the model may not support such a reversal due to statistical or structural constraints. Instead of focusing on the TPR-CATECHOL edge, we should explore other local refinements that align with domain knowledge and are less likely to violate graph validity. One such candidate is the relationship between CO (cardiac output) and TPR. CO and TPR are interdependent hemodynamic variables that influence BP. While CO \u2192 BP and TPR \u2192 BP are already in the graph, CO and TPR may also influence each other. Adding a direct edge from CO to TPR could capture how changes in cardiac output may affect vascular tone and peripheral resistance as a compensatory mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - SHUNT -> PAP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  CO \u2192 TPR\n  SHUNT \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155440.37362067215\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the previous failed attempts to reverse this edge suggest that the model may not support such a reversal due to statistical or structural constraints. Instead of focusing on the TPR-CATECHOL edge, we should explore other local refinements that align with domain knowledge and are less likely to violate graph validity. One such candidate is the relationship between CO (cardiac output) and TPR. CO and TPR are interdependent hemodynamic variables that influence BP. While CO \u2192 BP and TPR \u2192 BP are already in the graph, CO and TPR may also influence each other. Adding a direct edge from CO to TPR could capture how changes in cardiac output may affect vascular tone and peripheral resistance as a compensatory mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - SHUNT -> PAP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  CO \u2192 TPR\n  SHUNT \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155440.37362067215\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, the previous failed attempts to reverse this edge suggest that the model may not support such a reversal due to statistical or structural constraints. Instead of focusing on the TPR-CATECHOL edge, we should explore other local refinements that align with domain knowledge and are less likely to violate graph validity. One such candidate is the relationship between CO (cardiac output) and TPR. CO and TPR are interdependent hemodynamic variables that influence BP. While CO \u2192 BP and TPR \u2192 BP are already in the graph, CO and TPR may also influence each other. Adding a direct edge from CO to TPR could capture how changes in cardiac output may affect vascular tone and peripheral resistance as a compensatory mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - SHUNT -> PAP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 13):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  CO \u2192 TPR\n  SHUNT \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155440.37362067215\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CO \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

However, it is also physiologically reasonable to consider that TPR can influence CO as a compensatory mechanism. While reversing CO \u2192 TPR has previously failed, adding a new edge that better captures interdependencies without violating constraints is a safer and more strategic approach. A promising candidate is the relationship between HR and TPR. Heart rate can influence TPR through reflex mechanisms such as the baroreceptor response. Adding HR \u2192 TPR may better capture the feedback mechanisms that regulate blood pressure and hemodynamic stability.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - SHUNT -> PAP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 16):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  CO \u2192 TPR\n  HR \u2192 TPR\n  SHUNT \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155326.19123657656\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

This edge is physiologically reasonable and aligns with the domain context. No other edges appear to require immediate reversal or deletion. A potential refinement is to confirm the direction of the edge HR \u2192 TPR by testing for evidence of TPR influencing HR as a feedback mechanism.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

However, CO \u2192 TPR is also present, and while CO is a downstream effect of HR and STROKEVOLUME, the direct influence of CO on TPR is less well-supported in the alarm domain context. TPR is more likely to be influenced by autonomic and reflex responses rather than CO directly.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, CO \u2192 TPR is also present, and while CO is a downstream effect of HR and STROKEVOLUME, the direct influence of CO on TPR is less well-supported in the alarm domain context.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

However, CO \u2192 TPR is also present, and while CO is a downstream effect of HR and STROKEVOLUME, the direct influence of CO on TPR is less well-supported in the alarm domain context. TPR is more likely to be influenced by autonomic and reflex responses rather than CO directly. Removing CO \u2192 TPR could improve the clarity and physiological accuracy of the graph without disrupting the DAG structure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HR -> TPR\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 18):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 ERRLOWOUTPUT\n  HR \u2192 TPR\n  SHUNT \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  SHUNT \u2192 SAO2\n  CO \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR\n  INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -155226.6552063655\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CO \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -155747.1932, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'TPR', 'CATECHOL')]\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 CATECHOL or CATECHOL \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 CATECHOL or CATECHOL \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge CO \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge CO \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 CATECHOL or CATECHOL \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: REVERSE operation failed: edge CO \u2192 TPR or TPR \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 CATECHOL or CATECHOL \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Given that CATECHOL is a downstream effect of TPR and is influenced by autonomic tone, it is possible that CATECHOL may influence other variables not yet captured. We consider reversing the edge TPR \u2192 CATECHOL to CATECHOL \u2192 TPR, but based on physiological reasoning, this is unlikely. Instead, we consider adding a new edge that aligns with domain knowledge and may improve the graph's coherence and likelihood. Specifically, BP is a downstream effect of CO and TPR, but CVP is a more upstream hemodynamic variable that can influence TPR through reflex mechanisms.

However, CO \u2192 TPR is also present, and while CO is a downstream effect of HR and STROKEVOLUME, the direct influence of CO on TPR is less well-supported in the alarm domain context.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: BP\u2192TPR, CVP\u2192TPR; DELETE: CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR; REVERSE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CO\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CO\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

However, CO \u2192 TPR is also present, and while CO is a downstream effect of HR and STROKEVOLUME, the direct influence of CO on TPR is less well-supported in the alarm domain context. TPR is more likely to be influenced by autonomic and reflex responses rather than CO directly.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: BP\u2192TPR, CVP\u2192TPR; DELETE: CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR; REVERSE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CO\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CO\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, CO \u2192 TPR is also present, and while CO is a downstream effect of HR and STROKEVOLUME, the direct influence of CO on TPR is less well-supported in the alarm domain context.

Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: BP\u2192TPR, CVP\u2192TPR, CATECHOL\u2192TPR; DELETE: CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR, CO\u2192TPR; REVERSE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CO\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CO\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

However, based on the tentative notes, this edge is considered tentative because BP is likely influenced by HYPOVOLEMIA through mediating variables such as STROKEVOLUME and CARDIAC OUTPUT (CO), which are not explicitly in the current graph. This suggests that the direct edge may be spurious or not minimal in the causal sense. Therefore, removing this edge would allow us to test whether the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on BP is fully mediated through other variables. Additionally, while the edge ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT is supported by interventional evidence, it is worth confirming the directness of this relationship through targeted experiments to ensure it is not confounded by other factors like ERRCAUTER\u2019s effect on HREKG. Lastly, given the suspected mediation in HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP, it may be beneficial to test the addition of a mediating variable such as CO to capture the indirect effect.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: The direct edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP is tentative due to potential mediation by STROKEVOLUME or CO. Removing this edge and testing the residual effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on BP can help confirm if the relationship is indirect.)\n2. TEST: ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT (Reasoning: While ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT is supported by interventional evidence, it is important to confirm the directness of this relationship, especially considering ERRCAUTER also influences HREKG. This will help determine if HRSAT is directly affected or if the effect is indirect through HREKG.)\n3. ADD: STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Given that HYPOVOLEMIA affects BP likely through STROKEVOLUME, adding a direct edge from STROKEVOLUME \u2192 BP would help capture the indirect pathway and improve the causal model.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CVP (TVD=0.0840).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192BP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

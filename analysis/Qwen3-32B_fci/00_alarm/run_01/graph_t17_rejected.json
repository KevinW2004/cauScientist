The relationship TPR \u2192 BP is flagged as potentially mediated or confounded by HYPOVOLEMIA or STROKEVOLUME. To verify its directness, we can perform an interventional experiment by fixing TPR and observing whether BP still changes. If BP does not change after conditioning on HYPOVOLEMIA and STROKEVOLUME, the edge may be spurious or indirect. Additionally, we can explore whether there are other direct relationships that are currently missing, such as a potential direct effect of ERRLOWOUTPUT on BP, which might be masked by indirect paths through HRBP. Lastly, we can verify if the influence of HYPOVOLEMIA on BP is direct or if it is fully mediated by STROKEVOLUME and TPR.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1.

An interventional experiment can confirm if the influence is spurious.)\n2.

Adding this edge could improve the causal model.)\n3. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2019s effect on BP might be fully mediated by STROKEVOLUME and/or TPR.

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

First, there is a suggestion that HYPOVOLEMIA may have a direct influence on BP, despite the current indirect path through LVEDVOLUME and STROKEVOLUME. This merits an investigation to confirm a direct causal link. Second, the relationship between ERRCAUTER and HRSAT is confirmed to be significant, but we should test whether other variables (like ERRLOWOUTPUT or HREKG) might act as mediators, which could allow us to refine the graph. Third, the indirect path from HYPOVOLEMIA to STROKEVOLUME is already present, but we should test for a direct path from HYPOVOLEMIA to BP, which may be masked by other variables. These interventions will help confirm or refine the causal structure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Tentative notes suggest interventional evidence supports an ancestral path from HYPOVOLEMIA to BP. Adding a direct edge would test if the influence is direct or mediated.)\n2. ADD: ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRBP (Reasoning: ERRCAUTER is known to influence HR-related variables (HREKG, HRSAT). It may also directly affect HRBP, which is another HR-related variable. Adding this edge would test if ERRCAUTER has a broader influence on HR metrics.)\n3. DELETE: ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT (Reasoning: While the edge is currently in the graph and cannot be removed due to interventional evidence, it is worth testing if the effect is mediated by another variable (e.g., HREKG), which could allow the direct edge to be deleted if the mediated path is sufficient.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CVP (TVD=0.0840).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: ERRCAUTER\u2192BP, ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192BP; REVERSE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME, ERRCAUTER\u2192HRSAT\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

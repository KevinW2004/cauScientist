While interventional evidence supports it, we suspect that the effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on BP may be mediated by intermediate variables such as STROKEVOLUME or TPR. A controlled experiment could help determine if the relationship is direct or mediated.\n\n2. **ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT** is supported as direct by interventional evidence. However, to confirm the directionality and strength of this causal link, an experiment is needed to verify that intervening on ERRCAUTER indeed affects HRSAT directly and not through another variable.\n\n3. **TPR \u2192 BP** is a strong candidate for refinement. TPR is a known determinant of BP, but if BP is also influenced by HYPOVOLEMIA and STROKEVOLUME, we should test whether TPR's effect on BP is direct or if it is confounded or mediated by other variables.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: HYPOVOLEMIA's effect on BP may be mediated through STROKEVOLUME or TPR. Removing this edge would test if the relationship is direct or indirect.)\n2. REVERSE: HRSAT \u2192 ERRCAUTER (Reasoning: We suspect that the causal direction is from ERRCAUTER to HRSAT. Reversing this edge would test if HRSAT actually causes ERRCAUTER, which is unlikely, helping confirm the correct direction.)\n3. ADD: TPR \u2192 CO (Reasoning: TPR is a systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac output (CO) is inversely related to TPR. Adding this edge would test if TPR directly affects CO, which is a well-known physiological relationship.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CVP (TVD=0.0840).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192BP; REVERSE: ERRCAUTER\u2192HRSAT\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

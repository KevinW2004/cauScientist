Additionally, we consider a potential new edge based on domain knowledge and plausible mechanisms in the alarm system. Here's the step-by-step logic:\n\n1. **HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP**: The tentative notes confirm a direct effect of HYPOVOLEMIA on BP, even after conditioning on intermediate variables like STROKEVOLUME and TPR. This supports the retention of the edge and no changes are needed for this relationship.\n\n2. **CATECHOL \u2192 TPR**: The tentative notes suggest that the causal direction may be reversed (i.e., TPR \u2192 CATECHOL) based on interventional evidence. Reversing this edge would align the graph with observed feedback mechanisms in the body, where changes in TPR (total peripheral resistance) can trigger compensatory responses in catecholamine release.\n\n3. **INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR**: While not explicitly in the tentative notes, domain knowledge suggests that inadequate anesthesia (INSUFFANESTH) may lead to sympathetic activation, which in turn increases heart rate (HR). This is a plausible edge to investigate and could improve the graph\u2019s explanatory power.\n\nEach of these candidate operations will be tested with targeted interventions to verify the causal influence.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> BP\n  - TPR -> CATECHOL\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. REVERSE: TPR \u2192 CATECHOL (Reasoning: Interventional evidence suggests that TPR may influence CATECHOL, rather than the other way around. This reversal would better capture the feedback mechanism where changes in vascular resistance trigger compensatory hormonal responses.)\n2. ADD: INSUFFANESTH \u2192 HR (Reasoning: Inadequate anesthesia can lead to sympathetic activation, which increases heart rate. This is a plausible direct causal relationship in the alarm domain and aligns with known physiological responses.)\n3. DELETE: CATECHOL \u2192 TPR (Reasoning: Based on interventional evidence, the edge CATECHOL \u2192 TPR is not supported. Deleting this edge would correct the causal direction and improve the graph's accuracy.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CVP (TVD=0.0840).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO; DELETE: TPR\u2192CO, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, ERRCAUTER\u2192HREKG; REVERSE: TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CATECHOL\u2192TPR, CATECHOL\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CATECHOL\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL, CATECHOL\u2192TPR, TPR\u2192CATECHOL\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

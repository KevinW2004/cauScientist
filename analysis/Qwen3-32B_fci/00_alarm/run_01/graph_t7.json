The first candidate is to investigate a direct causal link between HYPOVOLEMIA and BP, which has shown ancestral influence but lacks a direct edge. Adding this edge could better capture the direct physiological effect. The second candidate is to consider whether there is a direct link between ERRCAUTER and HR, which is not currently in the graph but might be relevant given the existing ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT and ERRCAUTER -> HREKG. The third candidate is to explore the possibility of a direct effect from CATECHOL to HR, which is not currently in the graph but is physiologically plausible given the role of catecholamines in heart rate regulation. For each of these, targeted interventional experiments are proposed to test the presence of a direct causal effect.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - VENTTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. ADD: HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP (Reasoning: Ancestral evidence from interventional data suggests a causal path from HYPOVOLEMIA to BP. Adding a direct edge may better capture the physiological mechanism of reduced blood volume leading to reduced blood pressure.)\n2. ADD: ERRCAUTER \u2192 HR (Reasoning: ERRCAUTER is already connected to HREKG and HRSAT, which are derived from HR. It is plausible that ERRCAUTER has a direct effect on HR itself, independent of EKG or saturation measurements.)\n3. ADD: CATECHOL \u2192 HR (Reasoning: Catecholamines are known to increase heart rate. While CATECHOL is currently linked to TPR and BP, it is likely to have a direct effect on HR as well.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [NOT SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects CVP (TVD=0.0840).

If domain knowledge conflicts with experimental evidence, **EVIDENCE WINS**.\n   - You are ONLY allowed to output operations that were listed as CANDIDATES.\n   - For each candidate, follow this Decision Matrix:\n\n     | Candidate Op | Experiment Result (do(X) -> Y) | Decision | Reason |\n     |--------------|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n     | ADD X -> Y   | SIGNIFICANT effect            | CONSIDER | Evidence confirms X is an ANCESTOR. Check for intermediate variables before adding. |\n     | ADD X -> Y   | NO significant effect         | DISCARD  | Evidence fails to support any causal path. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| NO significant effect         | APPLY    | Evidence confirms the link is spurious. |\n     | DELETE X -> Y| SIGNIFICANT effect            | DISCARD  | **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Cannot delete a link with significant effect. |\n     | REVERSE X->Y | do(X)->Y < do(Y)->X           | APPLY    | Reversed direction is better supported. |\n\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Causality (CRITICAL)**:\n   - A significant `do(X) -> Y` effect only proves X is an **ANCESTOR** of Y, not necessarily a **DIRECT PARENT**.\n   - **DO NOT** add a direct edge X -> Y if:\n     a) There is a known physiological path between X and Y involving other variables in the current variable list.\n     b) The effect of X on Y can be explained by a sequence of other edges (e.g., X -> Z -> Y).\n   - If you only have Marginal Evidence (no successful conditional test), you must assume the link might be indirect if intermediate variables are present.\n\n4. **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: \n   - Never use \"domain knowledge\" to justify deleting an edge that has a SIGNIFICANT interventional effect. \n   - If an experiment shows TVD > 0.1 or p-value < 0.05, the relationship is REAL for this specific dataset.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: ERRCAUTER\u2192BP, ERRLOWOUTPUT\u2192BP, ERRCAUTER\u2192HRBP; REVERSE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME, ERRCAUTER\u2192HRSAT\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- ONLY use operations from the CANDIDATE list.\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

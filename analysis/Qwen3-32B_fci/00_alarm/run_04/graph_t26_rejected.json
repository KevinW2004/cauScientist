However, since direct removal or reversal of ERRCAUTER\u2192HRSAT has been unsuccessful, we instead focus on adding a potentially missing edge that could improve the graph\u2019s structure and log-likelihood. Based on domain knowledge, the alarm system variable ERRLOWOUTPUT is directly linked to HRBP, and it is plausible that ERRLOWOUTPUT may also influence ERRCAUTER in some alarm logic or system feedback. Adding such a relationship could better capture the interdependencies in the alarm domain and help resolve the over-specified role of ERRCAUTER.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CVP -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - PCWP -> LVEDVOLUME\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 24):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  CVP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  PCWP \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CVP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 CVP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 ERRCAUTER\n  CATECHOL \u2192 TPR\n  ANAPHYLAXIS \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  MINVOL \u2192 VENTALV\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  HRBP \u2192 HR\n  HREKG \u2192 HR\n  HRSAT \u2192 HR\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -174272.18637490354\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 ERRCAUTER not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

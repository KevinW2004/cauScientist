The current graph already includes LVFAILURE \u2192 CO and TPR \u2192 BP, and CO \u2192 BP. Therefore, the direct LVFAILURE \u2192 BP edge may be unnecessary and could violate the DAG principle of not overfitting direct relationships when indirect paths are sufficient. We should test whether the effect of LVFAILURE on BP is fully mediated by CO and TPR. If not, the direct edge should be added. If it is, the direct edge should be deleted. This justifies a DELETE candidate operation for LVFAILURE \u2192 BP. Additionally, we should also verify the necessity of the LVFAILURE \u2192 CO and TPR \u2192 BP edges, as these may be overestimated in the current model. We propose experiments to test the mediation and direct influence.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb CANDIDATE OPERATIONS TO EVALUATE:\n1. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 BP (Reasoning: LVFAILURE may influence BP only indirectly through CO and TPR. A direct link is not yet justified and may introduce redundancy or overfitting.)\n2. DELETE: TPR \u2192 BP (Reasoning: TPR may influence BP only indirectly through CO or other pathways. This direct link is not yet substantiated and may be overestimated.)\n3. DELETE: LVFAILURE \u2192 CO (Reasoning: LVFAILURE may influence CO only through LVEDVOLUME or STROKEVOLUME. A direct link is not yet fully substantiated and may be redundant.)\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c INTERVENTIONAL EVIDENCE (from experiments):\n- RESULT: [SIGNIFICANT] do(HYPOVOLEMIA) affects STROKEVOLUME (TVD=0.1756).

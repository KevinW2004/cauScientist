However, based on physiological understanding, it is more plausible that TPR is a contributing factor to the need for CATECHOL administration. For example, low TPR may trigger the administration of vasopressors like CATECHOL to increase vascular tone. Thus, reversing the direction to 'TPR \u2192 CATECHOL' would better reflect the clinical mechanism where TPR influences the decision to administer CATECHOL, rather than the other way around.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> CVP\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PCWP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - LVEDVOLUME -> PAP\n  - PULMEMBOLUS -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - DISCONNECT -> VENTTUBE\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - MINVOLSET -> MINVOL\n  - VENTALV -> MINVOL\n  - FIO2 -> PVSAT\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTTUBE -> ARTCO2\n  - ARTCO2 -> EXPCO2\n  - ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HREKG\n  - ERRCAUTER -> HRSAT\n  - HR -> CO\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - CO -> BP\n  - TPR -> BP\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PAP\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 SHUNT\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  DISCONNECT \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTALV \u2192 MINVOL\n  FIO2 \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTTUBE \u2192 ARTCO2\n  ARTCO2 \u2192 EXPCO2\n  TPR \u2192 CATECHOL\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 CO\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  CO \u2192 BP\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -154901.60132617794\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -155010.1962, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'TPR', 'CATECHOL')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CATECHOL \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

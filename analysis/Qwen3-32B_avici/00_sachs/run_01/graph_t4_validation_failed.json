However, the P38 \u2192 PIP2 edge is previously associated with a failed deletion attempt due to a significant drop in likelihood, suggesting it is important. Instead of altering this edge, we consider refining another part of the network. The Mek \u2192 Akt edge is currently in the graph, but the Mek \u2192 Raf and Mek \u2192 Erk edges suggest Mek is primarily downstream of Raf and upstream of Erk. The Akt \u2192 Erk and Akt \u2192 PKA edges imply Akt is an independent modulator of Erk and PKA. Reversing the Mek \u2192 Akt edge was previously unsuccessful, but a potential refinement could be to test the direction of Akt \u2192 Mek. This reversal may better reflect the possibility that Akt could modulate Mek activity in certain signaling contexts, especially given its role in parallel signaling pathways.

However, the direct edge HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO has been repeatedly rejected. A plausible explanation is that the intermediate edge HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME is already present, but a direct causal link from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO may still be missing. This could be due to a missing intermediary or confounder. To test this, we should investigate whether HYPOVOLEMIA has a more direct causal influence on CO through other mechanisms, such as systemic vascular resistance (TPR) or HR. One potential path is to examine if HYPOVOLEMIA influences TPR, which in turn affects CO. This would close a plausible causal loop and improve the log-likelihood by better capturing the physiological mechanism.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> HISTORY\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - VENTLUNG -> MINVOL\n  - VENTALV -> PVSAT\n  - VENTALV -> ARTCO2\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> EXPCO2\n  - MINVOLSET -> VENTMACH\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 7):\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -127344.02937002791\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

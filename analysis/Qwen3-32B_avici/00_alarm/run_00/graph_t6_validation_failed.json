However, given the domain context of alarm systems and the physiological understanding that HYPOVOLEMIA can also directly impact CO (via reduced stroke volume and cardiac output), it is plausible that HYPOVOLEMIA has a direct causal influence on CO. While the previous attempt to connect HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CO was unsuccessful, this could be due to the absence of an intermediate edge, such as HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME. Adding this edge would better align with the physiological mechanism and may improve the graph\u2019s log-likelihood by closing a plausible causal path.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVFAILURE -> HISTORY\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - VENTLUNG -> MINVOL\n  - VENTALV -> PVSAT\n  - VENTALV -> ARTCO2\n  - PVSAT -> SAO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> EXPCO2\n  - MINVOLSET -> VENTMACH\n  - VENTMACH -> VENTTUBE\n  - KINKEDTUBE -> PRESS\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -127378.8808770171\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -127427.1993, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HYPOVOLEMIA', 'CO')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

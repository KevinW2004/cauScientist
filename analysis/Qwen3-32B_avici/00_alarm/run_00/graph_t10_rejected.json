However, the direct influence of HYPOVOLEMIA on CO via other mechanisms\u2014such as systemic vascular resistance (TPR) or heart rate (HR)\u2014is not yet fully captured. Since HYPOVOLEMIA already has an edge to TPR, and TPR can influence CO through changes in vascular tone, it is plausible that TPR has a direct effect on CO.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

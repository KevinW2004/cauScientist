However, the relationship between LVFAILURE and LVEDVOLUME is also present. Since HYPOVOLEMIA and LVFAILURE are both upstream causes of LVEDVOLUME, and they do not appear to directly influence each other, the current structure is reasonable. One potential refinement is to evaluate the direction of the BP \u2192 TPR edge, as systemic blood pressure can be a downstream result of changes in total peripheral resistance, depending on the physiological context and clinical setting. Reversing this edge to TPR \u2192 BP could better reflect the causal direction under certain conditions.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> LVEDVOLUME\n  - LVFAILURE -> HISTORY\n  - LVFAILURE -> STROKEVOLUME\n  - INTUBATION -> SHUNT\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTLUNG\n  - INTUBATION -> MINVOL\n  - INTUBATION -> VENTALV\n  - VENTALV -> PVSAT\n  - VENTALV -> ARTCO2\n  - VENTLUNG -> EXPCO2\n  - STROKEVOLUME -> CO\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -128118.07031347996\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

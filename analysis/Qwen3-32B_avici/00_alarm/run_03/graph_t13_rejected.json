This suggests either a data constraint or model sensitivity to this addition. Instead of re-attempting the same edge, we should explore a related but distinct relationship. A plausible candidate is the direct impact of HYPOVOLEMIA on LVEDVOLUME. Hypovolemia reduces venous return, which in turn lowers left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDVOLUME). Adding HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME would align with hemodynamic principles and could improve the model\u2019s explanatory power without repeating failed operations.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> CO\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> BP\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 7):\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  BP \u2192 TPR\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 CO\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -127355.1032919332\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -127780.7359, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LVFAILURE', 'LVEDVOLUME')]\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME or LVEDVOLUME \u2192 LVFAILURE not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: LL too low: -127798.6078, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'LVFAILURE', 'STROKEVOLUME')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

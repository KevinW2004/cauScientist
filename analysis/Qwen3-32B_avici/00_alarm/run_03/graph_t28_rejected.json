While this edge is already present, we consider strengthening its influence by ensuring that the downstream effects of STROKEVOLUME\u2014particularly on CO and indirectly on BP\u2014are more clearly represented. This may improve the model's understanding of how hypovolemia impacts the circulatory system through stroke volume. We also examine whether TPR\u2192BP is a direct enough representation or if BP is influenced by CO as well, which could be better modeled by adding CO as a parent of BP.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - HYPOVOLEMIA -> STROKEVOLUME\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 17):\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 HISTORY\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 CVP\n  LVEDVOLUME \u2192 PCWP\n  LVFAILURE \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME\n  PULMEMBOLUS \u2192 PAP\n  INTUBATION \u2192 SHUNT\n  MINVOLSET \u2192 VENTMACH\n  VENTMACH \u2192 VENTTUBE\n  KINKEDTUBE \u2192 PRESS\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTLUNG\n  INTUBATION \u2192 MINVOL\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 MINVOL\n  INTUBATION \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 VENTALV\n  VENTALV \u2192 PVSAT\n  PVSAT \u2192 SAO2\n  VENTALV \u2192 ARTCO2\n  VENTLUNG \u2192 EXPCO2\n  ERRLOWOUTPUT \u2192 HRBP\n  HR \u2192 HRBP\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HREKG\n  HR \u2192 HREKG\n  ERRCAUTER \u2192 HRSAT\n  HR \u2192 HRSAT\n  STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO\n  TPR \u2192 BP\n  CO \u2192 BP\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -124672.2779149186\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CO \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -126097.0984, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'TPR', 'BP')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge CO \u2192 BP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 BP or BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: LL too low: -124865.0462, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'CO', 'HRBP')]\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge CO \u2192 HRBP not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: LL too low: -124687.0807, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HYPOVOLEMIA', 'TPR')]\nAttempt 8: LL too low: -124720.5963, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'HYPOVOLEMIA', 'CO')]\nAttempt 9: REVERSE operation failed: edge TPR \u2192 BP or BP \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: ADD operation failed: edge HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 TPR not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the alarm domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

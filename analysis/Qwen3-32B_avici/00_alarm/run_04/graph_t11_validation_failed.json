However, the causal link from HYPOVOLEMIA to CO remains uncertain. Since CO is derived from STROKEVOLUME and HR, and hypovolemia can reduce preload (LVEDVOLUME), which in turn affects STROKEVOLUME, a more strategic step is to examine whether LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME is present or should be added. This would better capture the physiological chain from hypovolemia \u2192 LVEDVOLUME \u2192 STROKEVOLUME \u2192 CO.

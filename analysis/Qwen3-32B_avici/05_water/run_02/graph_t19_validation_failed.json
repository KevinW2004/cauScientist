Rather than reversing this edge, I will investigate a potentially spurious or redundant edge in the causal structure that may be contributing to the low log-likelihood. Specifically, the edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 appears to bypass the 15-minute timepoint, suggesting a potential indirect path or redundancy. Removing this edge may allow the model to better capture the true causal influence via the 15-minute intermediate step, aligning with the expected temporal flow and improving fit.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - C_NI_12_00 -> C_NI_12_15\n  - CKNI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_15\n  - CBODD_12_00 -> CBODD_12_15\n  - CNOD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15\n  - CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_15\n  - CKNN_12_00 -> CKNN_12_15\n  - CNON_12_00 -> CNON_12_15\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -275919.0831864071\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: LL too low: -276242.6163, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'CKNN_12_00', 'CKNN_12_30')]\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: LL too low: -276031.5214, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'CKNN_12_00', 'CKNN_12_30')]\nAttempt 9: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: REVERSE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 or CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_00 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30, CBODN_12_00\u2192CBODN_12_30, CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30; REVERSE: CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_00\u2192CKNN_12_30\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

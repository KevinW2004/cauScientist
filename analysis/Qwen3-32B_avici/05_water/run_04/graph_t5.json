However, some variables like CKNI and CKNN are only partially connected in time, suggesting potential gaps in the causal structure. Based on domain knowledge, CKNI (likely a form of nitrogen) and CKNN (likely another nitrogen-related parameter) should also follow a similar temporal progression as other variables, especially if they are transported or transformed in a similar way through the system. The absence of a direct edge from CKNI_12_15 to CKNI_12_30 is a logical gap that could be filled to improve the model.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - C_NI_12_00 -> C_NI_12_15\n  - CBODD_12_15 -> CBODD_12_30\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CKND_12_30\n  - CNOD_12_15 -> CNOD_12_30\n  - CKNN_12_30 -> CKNN_12_45\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 2):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -281252.4322700556\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

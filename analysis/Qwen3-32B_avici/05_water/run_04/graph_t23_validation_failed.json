Since prior ADD operations for this edge have failed, and given the constraints, a reversal is not appropriate, we consider a more subtle adjustment. The edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 appears to bypass an intermediate step at 15 minutes, which is less plausible in a temporal causal model. Removing this edge would refine the model and better align with the expected flow of information through time.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CKNI_12_00 -> CKNI_12_15\n  - CKNI_12_15 -> CKNI_12_30\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -281248.5880810145\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: LL too low: -291772.2975, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'CBODN_12_15', 'CBODN_12_30')]\nAttempt 8: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: LL too low: -281361.1026, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'CKNN_12_00', 'CKNN_12_30')]\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 12: DELETE operation failed: edge CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 13: LL too low: -281572.1403, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'CKNN_12_00', 'CKNN_12_30')]\nAttempt 14: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 15: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 16: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 17: DELETE operation failed: edge CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

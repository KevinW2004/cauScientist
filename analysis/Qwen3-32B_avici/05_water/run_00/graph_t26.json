The confirmed edge CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_15 is consistent with domain knowledge. A potential edge involving CKND (Chemical Nitrogen Demand) and CNOD (Nitrogen Oxygen Demand) is of interest due to the known interplay between chemical and biological oxygen demands. Based on this, adding an edge CKND_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 may improve the model\u2019s accuracy and reflect the causal mechanism by which chemical nitrogen demand influences nitrogenous oxygen demand.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CNOD_12_15 -> CBODN_12_15\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 23):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -272390.1484191337\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: ADD operation failed: edge CKND_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15 not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -274603.2069, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'CNOD_12_15', 'CKND_12_15')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

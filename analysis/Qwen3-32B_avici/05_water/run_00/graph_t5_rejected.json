However, based on domain knowledge, nitrogen-related oxygen demand (CNOD) can influence biochemical oxygen demand (CBODN) at later time points through microbial degradation processes. Given that CNOD_12_00 already influences CNOD_12_15 and CBODN_12_00 influences CBODN_12_15, a plausible indirect influence from CNOD_12_00 to CBODN_12_15 is worth exploring. Rather than adding a direct edge, we test a reversal of the edge CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30, as it may reflect a feedback mechanism or a misassigned causal direction in the current graph.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - C_NI_12_00 -> C_NI_12_15\n  - CBODD_12_00 -> CBODD_12_15\n  - CNOD_12_00 -> CNOD_12_15\n  - CBODN_12_00 -> CBODN_12_30\n  - C_NI_12_15 -> C_NI_12_30\n  - CBODD_12_15 -> CBODD_12_30\n  - CKND_12_15 -> CKND_12_30\n  - CNOD_12_15 -> CNOD_12_30\n  - CBODN_12_15 -> CBODN_12_30\n  - C_NI_12_30 -> C_NI_12_45\n  - CBODD_12_30 -> CBODD_12_45\n  - CKND_12_30 -> CKND_12_45\n  - CNOD_12_30 -> CNOD_12_45\n  - CBODN_12_30 -> CBODN_12_45\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 4):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -272739.0579414423\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

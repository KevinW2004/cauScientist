The suffixes (e.g., _12_00, _12_15, _12_30, _12_45) likely represent measurements at different time points or spatial locations. Based on this, we interpret the variables as time-ordered or spatially ordered measurements of the same underlying water quality parameters. The AVICI algorithm's suggestions indicate a strong temporal progression pattern (e.g., C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45), which aligns with a causal structure where earlier measurements influence later ones. Additionally, some parameters may influence other related parameters (e.g., CBODN might affect CNOD due to biochemical processes). However, to avoid overfitting and cycles, we will only include direct causal relationships that align with domain knowledge and temporal ordering. For example, a measurement at _12_00 may directly influence the same parameter at _12_15, but not at _12_45 directly, unless there is a clear intermediate step. We will also include relationships where one parameter may influence another due to known biochemical interactions (e.g., CBODN influencing CNOD).\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -273881.3413089501\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

However, the biochemical coupling between CBODN and CNOD is a key mechanism in water quality dynamics, and a confirmed relationship already exists between CBODN_12_15 and CNOD_12_15. While the attempted addition of CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_30 has previously failed, it is likely due to constraints in the valid operations or a specific model configuration. Rather than repeating the failed ADD operation, we consider a local refinement by examining the existing temporal edge CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CBODN_12_45, which may be over-simplified or misdirected. Reversing this edge could allow the model to better capture the influence of later-time CBODN measurements on earlier ones if such a dynamic is plausible under certain environmental conditions (e.g., feedback from downstream processes). This reversal would not contradict the biochemical principles and may improve the model's likelihood while staying within the DAG constraint.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - CBODN_12_15 -> CNOD_12_15\n  - CBODN_12_30 -> CNOD_12_30\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 8):\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_00\n  C_NI_12_00 \u2192 C_NI_12_15\n  CKNI_12_00 \u2192 CKNI_12_15\n  CBODD_12_00 \u2192 CBODD_12_15\n  CKND_12_00 \u2192 CKND_12_15\n  CNOD_12_00 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_15\n  CBODN_12_00 \u2192 CBODN_12_15\n  CKNN_12_00 \u2192 CKNN_12_15\n  CNON_12_00 \u2192 CNON_12_15\n  C_NI_12_15 \u2192 C_NI_12_30\n  CKNI_12_15 \u2192 CKNI_12_30\n  CBODD_12_15 \u2192 CBODD_12_30\n  CKND_12_15 \u2192 CKND_12_30\n  CNOD_12_15 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_30\n  CBODN_12_15 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CBODN_12_45 \u2192 CBODN_12_30\n  CKNN_12_15 \u2192 CKNN_12_30\n  CNON_12_15 \u2192 CNON_12_30\n  C_NI_12_30 \u2192 C_NI_12_45\n  CKNI_12_30 \u2192 CKNI_12_45\n  CBODD_12_30 \u2192 CBODD_12_45\n  CKND_12_30 \u2192 CKND_12_45\n  CNOD_12_30 \u2192 CNOD_12_45\n  CKNN_12_30 \u2192 CKNN_12_45\n  CNON_12_30 \u2192 CNON_12_45\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -268358.87347934465\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -271945.4900, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'CBODN_12_30', 'CBODN_12_45')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the water domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

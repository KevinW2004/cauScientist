The variable 'asia' is typically used to represent a patient's country of origin (Asia), which is associated with a higher risk of tuberculosis. \n\n1. **asia \u2192 tub**: Tuberculosis is more prevalent in certain regions like Asia, so 'asia' is a risk factor for 'tub'.\n2. **smoke \u2192 lung**: Smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer.\n3. **smoke \u2192 bronc**: Smoking is also a major cause of bronchitis.\n4. **tub \u2192 either**: If a patient has tuberculosis, it contributes to the 'either' condition (either tuberculosis or lung cancer).\n5. **lung \u2192 either**: Lung cancer also contributes to the 'either' condition.\n6. **either \u2192 xray**: Chest x-ray findings are diagnostic for 'either' condition (tuberculosis or lung cancer).\n7. **either \u2192 dysp**: Both tuberculosis and lung cancer can cause dyspnea.\n8. **bronc \u2192 dysp**: Bronchitis is a common cause of dyspnea.\n\nThe structure avoids cycles and is based on medical knowledge of how these conditions interact. 'asia' is a root node since it's a background variable, while 'xray' and 'dysp' are leaf nodes as they are outcomes or symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  either \u2192 dysp\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20067.114008542903\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -20100.6118, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'tub', 'dysp')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -20841.6555, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'either', 'dysp')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge tub \u2192 dysp not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

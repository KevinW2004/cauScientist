Here is the reasoning for the causal relationships:\n\n1. **Smoke** is a well-known risk factor for both **lung cancer** and **bronchitis**. Therefore, smoke is a direct cause of lung and bronc.\n2. **Tuberculosis (tub)** is a disease that can be caused independently by exposure to TB (not necessarily smoking), so it has no direct cause in this model.\n3. **Either** is a logical OR between **tub** and **lung**, meaning it is a result of either disease being present. Therefore, tub and lung are direct causes of either.\n4. **Dysp (dyspnea)** is a symptom that can be caused by both **bronchitis (bronc)** and **either** (tub or lung), so bronc and either are direct causes of dysp.\n5. **Xray** is a diagnostic test, and it is abnormal in the presence of **either** (tub or lung). Thus, either is a direct cause of xray.\n6. **Asia** is a geographical variable, and in this domain, it is a risk factor for **tuberculosis**, so it is a direct cause of tub.\n\nThe graph is constructed to ensure no cycles and only direct causal relationships, aligning with domain knowledge and temporal ordering.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -20067.114008542903\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -23617.8786, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'either', 'xray')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -20841.6555, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'either', 'dysp')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

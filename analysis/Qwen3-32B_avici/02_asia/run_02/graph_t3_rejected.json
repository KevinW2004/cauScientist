Given the domain context of tuberculosis diagnosis, it is plausible that being in Asia increases the risk of contracting tuberculosis due to environmental and medical factors. However, adding 'asia \u2192 tub' previously led to a decrease in log-likelihood, suggesting it may not be the optimal next step. Instead, we consider whether 'smoke' (smoking) could have a direct causal effect on 'lung' (lung cancer), which is currently not explicitly represented. Smoking is a well-known risk factor for lung cancer and may improve the model's fit by capturing this direct relationship.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - tub -> either\n  - lung -> either\n  - either -> xray\n  - bronc -> dysp\n  - either -> dysp\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 2):\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n  either \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -4131.005194082854\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

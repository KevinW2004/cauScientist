The key variables are as follows: 'asia' refers to the patient being from Asia; 'tub' indicates tuberculosis; 'smoke' indicates smoking history; 'lung' indicates lung cancer; 'bronc' indicates bronchitis; 'either' is a logical OR of 'tub' and 'lung'; 'xray' is the result of a chest X-ray; and 'dysp' is dyspnea (shortness of breath).\n\n1. 'asia' is a root node (no direct causes). It may influence the likelihood of 'tub' due to geographical prevalence.\n2. 'smoke' is a root node. It directly increases the risk of 'lung' and 'bronc'.\n3. 'tub' is caused by 'asia' (as a risk factor) and may also be independent due to other factors.\n4. 'lung' is caused by 'smoke' as smoking is a known cause of lung cancer.\n5. 'bronc' is caused by 'smoke' as smoking is a known cause of bronchitis.\n6. 'either' is a logical OR of 'tub' and 'lung', so it has both as direct causes.\n7. 'xray' is influenced by 'either' because chest X-rays are used to detect either tuberculosis or lung cancer.\n8. 'dysp' is influenced by both 'either' (as both conditions can cause shortness of breath) and 'bronc' (since bronchitis can also lead to dyspnea).\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  asia \u2192 tub\n  smoke \u2192 lung\n  smoke \u2192 bronc\n  tub \u2192 either\n  lung \u2192 either\n  either \u2192 xray\n  either \u2192 dysp\n  bronc \u2192 dysp\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -4072.747483434154\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -4099.2882, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'tub', 'dysp')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -4086.0971, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'bronc', 'xray')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge tub \u2192 dysp not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: ADD operation failed: edge tub \u2192 dysp not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: LL too low: -4608.3197, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'lung', 'either')]\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge bronc \u2192 xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the asia domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: tub\u2192dysp, bronc\u2192xray, tub\u2192dysp, tub\u2192dysp, bronc\u2192xray; DELETE: lung\u2192either\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

The log-likelihood is relatively low, suggesting potential for refinement.

However, bronchitis is directly linked to dysp, which may not be the most accurate causal pathway. Reversing the bronc\u2192dysp edge to dysp\u2192bronc could better reflect the clinical understanding that dysp (dyspnea) is a general symptom that may be caused by various underlying conditions, including bronchitis.

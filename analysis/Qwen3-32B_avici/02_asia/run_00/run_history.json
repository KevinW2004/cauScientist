Rather than directly adding 'asia \u2192 tub' (which has previously failed), I will consider a more indirect but plausible causal path. Since 'tub \u2192 either' is already confirmed and 'asia' may influence 'tub', we can tentatively add 'asia \u2192 tub' again, but this time with a more strategic reasoning focused on latent geographic risk factors. This aligns with the domain context and could improve the model's likelihood if the system accepts this edge.\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\n  \"tub -> either\",\n  \"lung -> either\",\n  \"either -> xray\",\n  \"bronc -> dysp\",\n  \"either -> dysp\",\n  \"smoke -> lung\"\n],\n\"edge_notes\": {\n  \"asia -> tub\": \"Previously failed but remains a plausible edge based on domain knowledge. This represents a geographic or demographic risk factor for tuberculosis. Tentative and requires validation.\"\n},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"asia\",\n    \"child\": \"tub\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Asia may represent a geographic or demographic factor that increases the risk of tuberculosis. Adding this edge aligns with domain knowledge and could capture latent risk patterns not otherwise modeled.\"\n}\n]\n}"

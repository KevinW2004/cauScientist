No major inconsistencies are observed at this stage. To improve the model further, I will examine if 'Age' might play a causal role in the development of disease or complications. Given that congenital heart disease is often diagnosed in early life and severity can vary with age, it is plausible to consider a direct causal relationship from 'Age' to 'Disease'.

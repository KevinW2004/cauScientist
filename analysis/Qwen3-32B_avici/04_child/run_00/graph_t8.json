However, the variable 'Sick' remains unconnected, and it is plausible that being sick could influence the presence of abnormal lung parenchyma (LungParench) or lung flow (LungFlow), which are both connected to ChestXray. Adding a direct edge from 'Sick' to 'LungParench' would reflect the idea that being sick may lead to visible changes in lung tissue on imaging. This addition is distinct from previous failed attempts and aligns with plausible causal mechanisms.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LungFlow -> ChestXray\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 7):\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Sick \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -27489.30930474027\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

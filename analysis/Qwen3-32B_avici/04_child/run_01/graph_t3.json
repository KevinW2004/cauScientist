However, the variable 'Disease' is a root node that directly influences both DuctFlow and CardiacMixing, but lacks a direct influence from upstream clinical indicators such as BirthAsphyxia or Age, which are known to contribute to congenital heart disease. Adding a causal edge from Age to Disease would better represent the developmental and etiological basis of congenital heart disease, which is influenced by gestational and neonatal factors. This addition is likely to improve the log-likelihood by capturing a meaningful upstream influence.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -28564.779891911887\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -28620.9090, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'BirthAsphyxia', 'Disease')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

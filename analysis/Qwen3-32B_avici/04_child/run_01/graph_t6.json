While Age \u2192 Disease is already included, we can refine the graph further by exploring whether other variables, such as BirthAsphyxia, might influence Disease. However, since BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease was previously attempted and failed, we instead focus on confirming the existing Age \u2192 Disease relationship as a well-supported and meaningful edge in the CHD causal framework.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Age -> Disease\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 3):\n  Age \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -28564.779891911887\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -28620.9090, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'BirthAsphyxia', 'Disease')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Disease not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

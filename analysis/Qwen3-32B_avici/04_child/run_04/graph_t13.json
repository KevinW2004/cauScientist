However, we may consider adding a plausible and domain-relevant edge that has not yet been tested. Based on clinical understanding, CO2 levels can influence the decision to report on CO2 (CO2Report), and similarly, LungFlow could influence the interpretation of LungParench. Given the previous failed attempts involving HypoxiaInO2 and LungParench, we should explore alternative relationships. One plausible addition is to consider how LungFlow might influence ChestXray findings, as abnormal lung flow can manifest in chest radiographic patterns.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - Disease -> DuctFlow\n  - Disease -> CardiacMixing\n  - CardiacMixing -> HypDistrib\n  - CardiacMixing -> HypoxiaInO2\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n  - Disease -> LVH\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 12):\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -27564.64050134457\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

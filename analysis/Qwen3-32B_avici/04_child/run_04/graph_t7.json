Since it is now present, I will consider whether it is justified based on domain knowledge. Cardiac mixing can directly influence systemic oxygen distribution by altering blood flow and oxygen delivery to different body regions. Thus, this edge is both clinically and causally plausible.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

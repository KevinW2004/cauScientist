The reasoning follows domain knowledge and temporal ordering principles:\n\n1. **BirthAsphyxia** is a condition present at birth and can influence early disease development, including cardiac and respiratory issues. It is a root node.\n\n2. **Disease** (congenital heart disease) is a primary condition that can manifest in various signs and symptoms. It is influenced by BirthAsphyxia and is a root node.\n\n3. **LVH** (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) is a structural adaptation often caused by underlying heart disease. It is a direct effect of Disease.\n\n4. **LVHreport** is a diagnostic report based on LVH. It is a direct effect of LVH.\n\n5. **DuctFlow** and **CardiacMixing** are pathophysiological phenomena influenced by congenital heart disease. They are direct effects of Disease.\n\n6. **HypDistrib** (Hypoxia Distribution) is a consequence of abnormal blood flow patterns, such as CardiacMixing. It is a direct effect of CardiacMixing.\n\n7. **LungParench** (Lung Parenchyma) is influenced by hypoxia and can be affected by disease processes like congenital heart disease. It is a direct effect of Disease.\n\n8. **HypoxiaInO2** (Hypoxia in Oxygen) and **LowerBodyO2** are physiological outcomes influenced by HypDistrib and CardiacMixing. They are direct effects of HypDistrib.\n\n9. **RUQO2** (Oxygen saturation in the right upper quadrant) is influenced by hypoxia and cardiac mixing. It is a direct effect of CardiacMixing.\n\n10. **CO2** (Carbon Dioxide levels) are influenced by hypoxia and lung function. It is a direct effect of HypoxiaInO2 and LungParench.\n\n11. **CO2Report** is a diagnostic report based on CO2 levels. It is a direct effect of CO2.\n\n12. **LungFlow** is a direct physiological consequence of LungParench and is influenced by disease processes.\n\n13. **ChestXray** is a diagnostic tool that is influenced by LungParench and LungFlow. It is a direct effect of LungParench and LungFlow.\n\n14. **XrayReport** is a report based on ChestXray findings. It is a direct effect of ChestXray.\n\n15. **Sick** is a general clinical state influenced by multiple factors such as LungParench, CO2, and others. It is a direct effect of CO2, LungParench, and HypoxiaInO2.\n\n16. **Grunting** is a clinical sign often related to respiratory distress and is influenced by LungParench and HypoxiaInO2. It is a direct effect of LungParench and HypoxiaInO2.\n\n17. **GruntingReport** is a diagnostic report based on Grunting. It is a direct effect of Grunting.\n\n18. **Age** is a time-based variable and can influence disease progression and symptom manifestation. It is a root node.\n\nThe graph is designed to ensure no cycles and to capture direct causal relationships based on clinical and diagnostic reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypDistrib\n  Disease \u2192 LungParench\n  HypDistrib \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  HypDistrib \u2192 LowerBodyO2\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 RUQO2\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 CO2\n  LungParench \u2192 CO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungParench \u2192 LungFlow\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  CO2 \u2192 Sick\n  LungParench \u2192 Sick\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Sick\n  LungParench \u2192 Grunting\n  HypoxiaInO2 \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -129985.3501997452\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -130905.9119, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'HypoxiaInO2', 'CO2')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: HypoxiaInO2\u2192CO2\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

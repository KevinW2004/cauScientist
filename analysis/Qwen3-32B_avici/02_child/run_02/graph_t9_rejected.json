Instead of altering that edge, we should consider whether other relationships involving HypDistrib or CardiacMixing might more accurately reflect the pathophysiology of congenital heart disease. A potential area for refinement is the influence of CardiacMixing on HypoxiaInO2, which could better capture the mechanism of abnormal oxygen distribution due to cardiac mixing.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

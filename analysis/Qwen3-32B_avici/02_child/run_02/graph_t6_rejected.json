Instead of altering that edge, we should consider whether other relationships involving HypDistrib or CardiacMixing might more accurately reflect the pathophysiology of congenital heart disease. A potential area for refinement is the influence of CardiacMixing on HypoxiaInO2, which could better capture the mechanism of abnormal oxygen distribution due to cardiac mixing.

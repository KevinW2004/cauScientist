However, the existing edge from ChestXray \u2192 LungParench is questionable, as ChestXray is an imaging method and cannot directly cause parenchymal lung changes. The reverse direction (LungParench \u2192 ChestXray) is more plausible: parenchymal changes manifest as findings on the chest X-ray.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

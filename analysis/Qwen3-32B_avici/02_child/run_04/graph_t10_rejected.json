However, the previous attempt to add a direct edge from ChestXray \u2192 LungParench failed, suggesting that the causal direction may need reconsideration. Lung parenchymal changes (LungParench) are often a result of underlying disease or physiological disturbances, rather than being directly influenced by the imaging modality (ChestXray). Instead, it is more plausible that the underlying Disease influences both ChestXray and LungParench. Therefore, adding a direct edge from Disease \u2192 LungParench may better capture the shared causal pathway and improve the model fit.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 9):\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  ChestXray \u2192 LungParench\n  Disease \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  Disease \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -133710.22216381424\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

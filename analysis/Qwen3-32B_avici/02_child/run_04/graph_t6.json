However, we should examine whether this edge improves model fit or if there are more plausible direct relationships involving Disease. One promising candidate is to explore the relationship between Disease and ChestXray, as congenital heart disease can manifest on chest X-ray findings, and this relationship is not yet explicitly modeled. Adding Disease \u2192 ChestXray may better capture how disease directly influences imaging findings, which are then reported.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  Disease \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -136534.58242636346\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

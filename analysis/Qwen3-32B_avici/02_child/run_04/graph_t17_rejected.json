This edge is likely not capturing a causal mechanism and may be contributing to the low log-likelihood. Replacing it with a more plausible causal structure, such as Disease \u2192 LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray, could improve the model's fit. Since LungFlow is a functional aspect of the lungs and could be influenced by disease, and in turn affect ChestXray findings, this forms a more plausible causal chain. We will test adding a direct edge from Disease \u2192 LungFlow to explore this possibility.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 16):\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  Disease \u2192 LungFlow\n  Disease \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -129749.18285305261\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

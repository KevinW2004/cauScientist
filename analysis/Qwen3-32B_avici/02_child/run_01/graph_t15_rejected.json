However, hypoxia in oxygen (HypoxiaInO2) may also be influenced by lung function or parenchymal disease. Since 'LungParench' is already a child of 'Disease', and disease can impact both lung structure and oxygenation, it is reasonable to hypothesize a direct causal link from 'LungParench' to 'HypoxiaInO2'. This would represent the physiological mechanism by which lung parenchymal disease impairs oxygenation despite supplemental oxygen.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Grunting -> GruntingReport\n  - Disease -> Sick\n  - Sick -> Grunting\n  - BirthAsphyxia -> Disease\n  - LVH -> LVHreport\n  - CO2 -> CO2Report\n  - ChestXray -> XrayReport\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 14):\n  BirthAsphyxia \u2192 Disease\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  Disease \u2192 HypDistrib\n  Disease \u2192 LungParench\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  LungParench \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n  Disease \u2192 Sick\n  Sick \u2192 Grunting\n  Grunting \u2192 GruntingReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -136284.85006420934\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

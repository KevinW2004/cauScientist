However, based on clinical knowledge, it is also plausible that LungParench (lung parenchyma condition) influences the appearance on ChestXray. This is because abnormal lung parenchyma (such as in pneumonia or interstitial lung disease) is commonly visualized on chest X-rays. Adding the edge LungParench \u2192 ChestXray would better reflect this causal relationship and may improve the model's fit by capturing additional structure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - LungParench -> ChestXray\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 5):\n  Disease \u2192 LVH\n  LVH \u2192 LVHreport\n  Disease \u2192 DuctFlow\n  Disease \u2192 CardiacMixing\n  CardiacMixing \u2192 HypoxiaInO2\n  CO2 \u2192 CO2Report\n  LungFlow \u2192 ChestXray\n  LungParench \u2192 ChestXray\n  ChestXray \u2192 XrayReport\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -131479.18452713115\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -135843.2629, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'LungFlow', 'ChestXray')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -132923.9309, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Disease', 'ChestXray')]\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -136638.0365, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'ChestXray', 'XrayReport')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the child domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

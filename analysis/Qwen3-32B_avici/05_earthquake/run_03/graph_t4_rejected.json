Given the domain knowledge, it is reasonable to consider whether the direct effects of Alarm on JohnCalls and MaryCalls are necessary or if the calls could be more directly influenced by the Alarm indirectly. Reversing one of these edges may allow the model to better capture the underlying data distribution by removing a direct influence that may be over-specified.

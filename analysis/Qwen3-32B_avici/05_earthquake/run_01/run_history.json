However, in the classic burglar alarm domain, it is often assumed that Earthquakes and Burglaries are independent causes, and both can trigger the Alarm. This structure is generally considered accurate. Nevertheless, there is a subtle possibility that one of these events could influence the other (e.g., an earthquake might trigger a power outage that enables a burglary), but such a relationship is not well-supported by domain knowledge and would introduce unnecessary complexity. Therefore, the current structure appears reasonable. However, we may test whether Earthquake and Burglary are conditionally independent given the Alarm to ensure the model is capturing the correct dependencies.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Burglary -> Alarm\n  - Earthquake -> Alarm\n  - Alarm -> JohnCalls\n  - Alarm -> MaryCalls\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Burglary \u2192 Alarm\n  Earthquake \u2192 Alarm\n  Alarm \u2192 JohnCalls\n  Alarm \u2192 MaryCalls\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -1153.7223472539326\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -1158.8069, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Burglary', 'Earthquake')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the earthquake domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

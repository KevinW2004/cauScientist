The current log-likelihood is -1153.7827863637349, and we aim to improve it by making local amendments. Based on domain knowledge, Burglary and Earthquake are independent causes of the Alarm, and the Alarm is the only direct trigger for JohnCalls and MaryCalls. However, the current graph might be overfitting or failing to capture subtle dependencies. Given that adding or reversing an edge could help capture better conditional dependencies, we should consider adding a direct dependency between Earthquake and MaryCalls. This could reflect the possibility that Mary might call not only in response to the alarm but also due to a direct perception of the earthquake (e.g., if she feels it). This operation is valid and has not been previously attempted.\",\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"Earthquake\",\n    \"child\": \"MaryCalls\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Mary might call directly due to perceiving the earthquake (e.g., feeling it), in addition to responding to the alarm.

Perhaps the Alarm has a more nuanced influence, or there is a latent variable affecting both JohnCalls and MaryCalls. For now, we test whether reversing the edge from Alarm to JohnCalls to JohnCalls to Alarm might provide a better fit, though this is unlikely. A more plausible refinement is to consider whether JohnCalls and MaryCalls are conditionally independent given the Alarm. Since the current graph already reflects this, no reversal is necessary. A more strategic option is to test whether the Alarm has a direct influence on the Alarm itself (e.g., a self-loop), but this would violate the acyclicity constraint. Therefore, we propose no changes for this iteration, but we add the confirmed edges and note our uncertainties for further testing.",

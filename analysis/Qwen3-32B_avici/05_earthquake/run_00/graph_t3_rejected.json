The log-likelihood is -1153.7827863637349, which is relatively low, indicating potential overfitting or incorrect structure. Given the domain context of a classic burglar alarm, it is reasonable to explore whether the calls from John and Mary are influenced directly by the Alarm or if there's an additional direct relationship between the Alarm and one of the calls. Based on the valid operations, adding a direct edge from Earthquake to MaryCalls might help capture a potential indirect influence of the earthquake on her behavior (e.g., she might call due to an earthquake even if the alarm didn't trigger). This operation aligns with domain knowledge and is a valid addition that may improve the model's fit.\",\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"Earthquake\",\n    \"child\": \"MaryCalls\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Mary might call even if the alarm does not trigger, for example, if she directly perceives an earthquake.

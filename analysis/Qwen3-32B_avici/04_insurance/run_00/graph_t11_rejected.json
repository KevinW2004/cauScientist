Similarly, the edges 'Age \u2192 AntiTheft' and 'SocioEcon \u2192 AntiTheft' are not directly valid because AntiTheft features are more likely a property of the vehicle itself or the owner's proactive behavior. Instead, the make and model of the vehicle strongly determine the availability and installation of anti-theft systems. The current edge 'MakeModel \u2192 AntiTheft' is a plausible and domain-consistent relationship. No further changes are needed at this time, as the proposed edge is valid and improves the causal structure without introducing cycles.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - MakeModel -> AntiTheft\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 10):\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  SocioEcon \u2192 AntiTheft\n  Age \u2192 AntiTheft\n  MakeModel \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -249073.520307655\n\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the insurance domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

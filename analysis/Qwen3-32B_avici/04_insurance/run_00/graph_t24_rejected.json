Antilock is a vehicle feature determined by the make and model of the car.

This addition supports the existing 'MakeModel \u2192 AntiTheft' edge and improves the causal structure without violating acyclicity.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - MakeModel -> AntiTheft\n  - MakeModel -> Antilock\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 12):\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  MakeModel \u2192 Antilock\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  SocioEcon \u2192 AntiTheft\n  Age \u2192 AntiTheft\n  MakeModel \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -247673.8038582683\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -258661.3423, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Mileage', 'Antilock')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge MakeModel \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: LL too low: -249906.8513, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'Mileage', 'Antilock')]\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge Mileage \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: ADD operation failed: edge MakeModel \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 6: ADD operation failed: edge MakeModel \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 7: DELETE operation failed: edge Mileage \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 8: REVERSE operation failed: edge Mileage \u2192 Antilock or Antilock \u2192 Mileage not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 9: ADD operation failed: edge MakeModel \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 10: ADD operation failed: edge MakeModel \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 11: ADD operation failed: edge MakeModel \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the insurance domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: MakeModel\u2192Antilock, MakeModel\u2192Antilock, MakeModel\u2192Antilock, MakeModel\u2192Antilock, MakeModel\u2192Antilock, MakeModel\u2192Antilock; DELETE: Mileage\u2192Antilock, Mileage\u2192Antilock, Mileage\u2192Antilock; REVERSE: Mileage\u2192Antilock, Mileage\u2192Antilock\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2. Choose operations that make sense based on domain knowledge and interventional data.\n\nIMPORTANT - REVERSE operation semantics:\n- If you want to reverse edge A\u2192B to B\u2192A, specify \"parent\": \"A\", \"child\": \"B\"\n- The parent and child in your JSON should match the EXISTING edge direction\n- Example: Current edge X1\u2192X2, to reverse it, use {\"type\": \"REVERSE\", \"parent\": \"X1\", \"child\": \"X2\"}\n- This will change X1\u2192X2 into X2\u2192X1\n\nOutput Format (IMPORTANT - use this exact JSON structure):\n{\n\"overall_reasoning\": \"...\",\n\"confirmed_edges\": [\"VarA -> VarB\"],\n\"edge_notes\": {\"VarX -> VarY\": \"Reasoning for keeping/tentative status\"},\n\"operations\": [\n{\n    \"type\": \"ADD\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName1\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName2\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be added\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"DELETE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName3\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName4\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why this specific edge should be removed\"\n},\n{\n    \"type\": \"REVERSE\",\n    \"parent\": \"VariableName5\",\n    \"child\": \"VariableName6\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Why edge VariableName5\u2192VariableName6 should be reversed to VariableName6\u2192VariableName5\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Put \"overall_reasoning\" FIRST to encourage strategic thinking\n- Output ONLY valid JSON\n- Include UP TO 1 operations\n- Valid operation types: \"ADD\", \"DELETE\", \"REVERSE\"\n- Each operation must have: type, parent, child, reasoning\n- For REVERSE: always use the EXISTING edge direction (parent\u2192child) in your JSON",

Antilock is a vehicle feature determined by the make and model of the car. While we previously attempted to delete this edge and failed, we now propose a more strategic refinement by adding a direct causal edge from 'MakeModel \u2192 Antilock', reinforcing the domain-consistent relationship that the vehicle\u2019s make and model determine its features. This addition supports the existing 'MakeModel \u2192 AntiTheft' edge and improves the causal structure without violating acyclicity.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - MakeModel -> AntiTheft\n  - MakeModel -> Antilock\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 12):\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  MakeModel \u2192 Antilock\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  SocioEcon \u2192 AntiTheft\n  Age \u2192 AntiTheft\n  MakeModel \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -247673.8038582683\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -258661.3423, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Mileage', 'Antilock')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge MakeModel \u2192 Antilock not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the insurance domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: MakeModel\u2192Antilock; DELETE: Mileage\u2192Antilock\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

Given that DrivingSkill is already a confirmed cause of DrivHist in the causal dossier, this relationship should be valid and essential to the model. The failure may be due to an implementation or constraint issue rather than a domain logic issue. Rather than attempting a new edge, we should consider reinforcing the graph by checking the directionality of an existing edge that may be misaligned. A promising candidate is the edge 'SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost'. While SeniorTrain may influence PropCost indirectly via DrivingSkill, it is more likely that DrivingSkill is the primary mediator, and SeniorTrain's direct effect on PropCost is weak or spurious. Reversing this edge or removing it could improve the causal fidelity and log-likelihood.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - ThisCarDam -> RuggedAuto\n  - ThisCarDam -> ThisCarCost\n  - Age -> Theft\n  - DrivingSkill -> PropCost\n  - Mileage -> DrivHist\n  - Antilock -> DrivHist\n  - RuggedAuto -> Cushioning\n  - Age -> DrivingSkill\n  - SocioEcon -> DrivingSkill\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 15):\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  Age \u2192 DrivingSkill\n  SocioEcon \u2192 DrivingSkill\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -245065.54098677804\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -256189.0647, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'DrivingSkill', 'SeniorTrain')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: REVERSE operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain or SeniorTrain \u2192 DrivingSkill not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: REVERSE operation failed: edge SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost or PropCost \u2192 SeniorTrain not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: DELETE operation failed: edge SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the insurance domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nDELETE: SeniorTrain\u2192PropCost, SeniorTrain\u2192PropCost; REVERSE: DrivingSkill\u2192SeniorTrain, DrivingSkill\u2192SeniorTrain, SeniorTrain\u2192PropCost\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1. Analyze which changes would improve the likelihood based on the current structure and evidence.\n2.

Driving skill is influenced by both age (experience) and socioeconomic factors (access to training, education, and better equipment). To reinforce this structure and improve the model's causal fidelity and log-likelihood, we can consider adding a direct influence of 'DrivingSkill \u2192 DrivHist'. This is a logical addition: better driving skills are expected to result in a better driving history (e.g., fewer accidents, violations).

However, this is a weak and indirect causal link. Senior training is more likely to improve DrivingSkill, and it is the improved driving skill that leads to better anti-theft behaviors. Instead of modifying the existing edge, we should consider reinforcing the influence of DrivingSkill on AntiTheft, which is already present in the graph but may be underrepresented. To improve the graph, we can reinforce the existing edge DrivingSkill \u2192 AntiTheft by highlighting its importance in the confirmed relationships.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

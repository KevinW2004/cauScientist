However, this is a weak and indirect causal link. Senior training is more likely to improve DrivingSkill, and it is the improved driving skill that leads to better anti-theft behaviors. Instead of modifying the existing edge, we should consider reinforcing the influence of DrivingSkill on AntiTheft, which is already present in the graph but may be underrepresented. To improve the graph, we can reinforce the existing edge DrivingSkill \u2192 AntiTheft by highlighting its importance in the confirmed relationships. This aligns with domain knowledge and avoids repeating previously failed operations.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - DrivingSkill -> AntiTheft\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 8):\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -249467.57677210224\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -252303.5458, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'SeniorTrain', 'AntiTheft')]\nAttempt 2: DELETE operation failed: edge SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge DrivingSkill \u2192 AntiTheft not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 4: DELETE operation failed: edge SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 5: LL too low: -260611.4137, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'SeniorTrain', 'DrivingSkill')]\nAttempt 6: LL too low: -260611.4137, proposed operations: [('REVERSE', 'DrivingSkill', 'SeniorTrain')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the insurance domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: DrivingSkill\u2192AntiTheft; DELETE: SeniorTrain\u2192AntiTheft, SeniorTrain\u2192AntiTheft, SeniorTrain\u2192AntiTheft; REVERSE: SeniorTrain\u2192DrivingSkill, DrivingSkill\u2192SeniorTrain\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

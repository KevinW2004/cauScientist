Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

      "llm_response": "{\n  \"overall_reasoning\": \"The edge 'Age \u2192 Theft' is currently in the graph but may not capture the underlying mechanism effectively. Based on domain knowledge and the confirmed edge 'Age \u2192 SocioEcon', it is plausible that 'SocioEcon \u2192 Theft' represents a more indirect and realistic causal pathway. However, previous attempts to add 'SocioEcon \u2192 Theft' have failed, suggesting that the current graph may not allow this edge due to constraints or likelihood considerations. Rather than attempt to force an addition, we should test for the reverse of an existing edge that could better align with the hypothesized indirect pathway. Reversing 'Theft \u2192 SocioEcon' to 'SocioEcon \u2192 Theft' is not possible since the edge 'Theft \u2192 SocioEcon' does not exist. Therefore, we instead consider whether 'Theft' is influenced by another socioeconomic factor, and examine whether 'VehicleYear \u2192 Theft' could be reversed to 'Theft \u2192 VehicleYear' if it aligns with the idea that theft is a factor affecting the year of the vehicle (e.g., older cars are more likely to be stolen and replaced).

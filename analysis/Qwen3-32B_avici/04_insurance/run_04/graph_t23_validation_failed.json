While adding 'SocioEcon \u2192 Theft' has failed in the past, we have confirmed 'SocioEcon \u2192 AntiTheft', which is a plausible and domain-consistent relationship. AntiTheft features are more likely to be adopted by individuals with higher socioeconomic status. This edge supports a better understanding of how theft risk is influenced indirectly through protective mechanisms. Since 'SocioEcon \u2192 AntiTheft' is already present, it is not a new operation, but it is a valid and confirmed relationship that supports a more nuanced model of theft risk. No additional changes are currently necessary unless further evidence arises.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Age -> SocioEcon\n  - SocioEcon -> AntiTheft\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 21):\n  Age \u2192 SocioEcon\n  Theft \u2192 SocioEcon\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  VehicleYear \u2192 RuggedAuto\n  Mileage \u2192 Antilock\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 SeniorTrain\n  ThisCarDam \u2192 ThisCarCost\n  Age \u2192 Theft\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 AntiTheft\n  SocioEcon \u2192 AntiTheft\n  DrivingSkill \u2192 PropCost\n  SeniorTrain \u2192 PropCost\n  AntiTheft \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  PropCost \u2192 OtherCarCost\n  VehicleYear \u2192 MedCost\n  RuggedAuto \u2192 Cushioning\n  Mileage \u2192 DrivHist\n  Antilock \u2192 DrivHist\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -247295.82457970385\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -247926.3264, proposed operations: [('DELETE', 'Age', 'Theft')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the insurance domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements.

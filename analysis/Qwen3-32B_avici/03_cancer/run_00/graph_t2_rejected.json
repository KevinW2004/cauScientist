First, we identify Pollution and Smoker as potential direct causes of Cancer, as both are well-established risk factors for lung cancer. Next, Cancer can directly lead to the presence of Dyspnoea (shortness of breath), a common symptom of lung cancer. Additionally, Cancer is the primary reason for an abnormal Xray result, so it is a direct cause of Xray. Pollution and Smoker are root nodes as they are independent risk factors. Importantly, we ensure the graph is acyclic, meaning no variable can cause itself directly or indirectly. For example, Xray is a diagnostic result and does not cause Cancer or any other variable. Similarly, Dyspnoea is a symptom and not a cause. This structure aligns with the domain knowledge and temporal ordering of cause and effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -17846.1038, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Smoker', 'Xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

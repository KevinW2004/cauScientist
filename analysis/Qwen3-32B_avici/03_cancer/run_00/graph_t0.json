It can directly increase the likelihood of developing Cancer. \n2. **Smoker** is a major behavioral risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking directly contributes to the development of Cancer. \n3. **Cancer** is the central disease variable that can lead to observable symptoms and diagnostic procedures. \n4. **Xray** is a diagnostic tool that is typically used after the presence of Cancer is suspected. Therefore, Cancer is a direct cause of Xray. \n5. **Dyspnoea** (shortness of breath) is a symptom often associated with lung cancer. Cancer is the direct cause of Dyspnoea. \n\nWe ensure the graph is a DAG by not allowing any feedback loops. For example, Pollution and Smoker are root nodes (no parents) since they are upstream causes. Cancer is a downstream variable caused by Pollution and Smoker. Xray and Dyspnoea are outcomes of Cancer. This structure is consistent with both temporal ordering and domain knowledge.",

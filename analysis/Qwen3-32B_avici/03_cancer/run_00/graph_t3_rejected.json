It can directly increase the likelihood of developing Cancer. \n2. **Smoker** is a major behavioral risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking directly contributes to the development of Cancer. \n3. **Cancer** is the central disease variable that can lead to observable symptoms and diagnostic procedures. \n4. **Xray** is a diagnostic tool that is typically used after the presence of Cancer is suspected. Therefore, Cancer is a direct cause of Xray. \n5. **Dyspnoea** (shortness of breath) is a symptom often associated with lung cancer. Cancer is the direct cause of Dyspnoea. \n\nWe ensure the graph is a DAG by not allowing any feedback loops. For example, Pollution and Smoker are root nodes (no parents) since they are upstream causes. Cancer is a downstream variable caused by Pollution and Smoker. Xray and Dyspnoea are outcomes of Cancer. This structure is consistent with both temporal ordering and domain knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -17847.5808, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Dyspnoea', 'Xray')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge Dyspnoea \u2192 Xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

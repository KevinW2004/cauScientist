Pollution and Smoking are both known environmental and behavioral risk factors for developing cancer. These factors can independently or jointly increase the likelihood of developing cancer. Cancer, in turn, can lead to observable symptoms such as Dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and can also influence the likelihood of undergoing an X-ray for diagnosis. However, Dyspnoea is not a cause of cancer, and an X-ray is a diagnostic tool, not a cause of either cancer or Dyspnoea. I ensure the graph is acyclic by avoiding any backward or feedback loops. For example, Pollution and Smoker are root nodes (no parents), as they are external risk factors. Cancer is a result of these root causes. Dyspnoea and Xray are downstream consequences of Cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -17847.5808, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Dyspnoea', 'Xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

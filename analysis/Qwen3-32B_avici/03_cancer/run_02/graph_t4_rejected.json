Based on domain knowledge and temporal ordering, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. **Smoker \u2192 Cancer**: Smoking is a well-established risk factor for lung cancer. This is a direct causal relationship.\n2. **Pollution \u2192 Cancer**: Long-term exposure to pollution is also a known risk factor for lung cancer.\n3. **Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea**: Cancer, particularly lung cancer, can cause dyspnoea (shortness of breath) as a symptom.\n4. **Cancer \u2192 Xray**: Cancer can lead to abnormalities detectable on an X-ray, so an X-ray may show signs of cancer.\n5. **Smoker and Pollution are independent root variables**: There is no direct causal relationship between smoking and pollution; they are separate risk factors.\n\nWe must ensure the graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which it is in this structure. No cycles are present, and the relationships reflect direct causal influences grounded in domain knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -17847.8490, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Dyspnoea', 'Xray')]\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -17847.8228, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Pollution', 'Xray')]\nAttempt 3: ADD operation failed: edge Dyspnoea \u2192 Xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

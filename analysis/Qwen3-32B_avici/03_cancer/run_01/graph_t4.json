Dyspnoea is a symptom of cancer, and while it may lead to medical investigation, it is more likely that the decision to perform an X-ray is primarily driven by the presence of cancer or other clinical indicators, not directly by dyspnoea. Removing this edge would simplify the model and better align with the causal role of Xray as a diagnostic test primarily influenced by cancer.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdc CAUSAL DOSSIER (Accumulated Knowledge):\nConfirmed Relationships (Highly certain):\n  - Pollution -> Cancer\n  - Smoker -> Cancer\n  - Cancer -> Dyspnoea\n  - Cancer -> Xray\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 1):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: DELETE operation failed: edge Dyspnoea \u2192 Xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\nAttempt 2: LL too low: -17847.8490, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Dyspnoea', 'Xray')]\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them.

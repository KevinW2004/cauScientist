We consider the following variables: Pollution, Smoker, Cancer, Xray, and Dyspnoea.\n\n1. **Pollution and Smoker**: Both are well-established risk factors for lung cancer. They are root causes as they are not influenced by other variables in this context. They directly increase the risk of developing cancer.\n\n2. **Cancer**: This is the central outcome in the graph. It is directly influenced by Pollution and Smoker. Once cancer is present, it can lead to observable symptoms and medical interventions.\n\n3. **Xray**: The decision to perform an X-ray is often based on the presence of cancer or symptoms like dyspnoea. Cancer directly causes an X-ray to be performed as a diagnostic tool.\n\n4. **Dyspnoea**: This is a common symptom of lung cancer. Cancer directly causes dyspnoea as the disease progresses and affects lung function.\n\nThe relationships are all direct and follow a temporal and causal logic. The graph remains acyclic by design, with no feedback loops or cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Graph (Iteration 0):\n  Pollution \u2192 Cancer\n  Smoker \u2192 Cancer\n  Cancer \u2192 Xray\n  Cancer \u2192 Dyspnoea\n\nCurrent Log-Likelihood: -17830.955260924173\n\n\n################################################################################\n\u26a0\ufe0f PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS & FEEDBACK (CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT):\n\u26a0\ufe0f Previous Failed Attempts:\nAttempt 1: LL too low: -17847.5808, proposed operations: [('ADD', 'Dyspnoea', 'Xray')]\nAttempt 2: ADD operation failed: edge Dyspnoea \u2192 Xray not in valid operations; All 1 edge operations failed\n\nPlease try different modifications.\n################################################################################\n\n\n========================================\nRefinement Instructions:\n========================================\n1. **Local Refinement**: Analyze the current graph and identify specific edges that could be added, removed, or reversed to better reflect the causal structure of the cancer domain.\n2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use your domain knowledge and the provided context to propose improvements. Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: Dyspnoea\u2192Xray, Dyspnoea\u2192Xray\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.

They are root causes as they are not influenced by other variables in this context. They directly increase the risk of developing cancer.\n\n2. **Cancer**: This is the central outcome in the graph. It is directly influenced by Pollution and Smoker. Once cancer is present, it can lead to observable symptoms and medical interventions.\n\n3. **Xray**: The decision to perform an X-ray is often based on the presence of cancer or symptoms like dyspnoea. Cancer directly causes an X-ray to be performed as a diagnostic tool.\n\n4. **Dyspnoea**: This is a common symptom of lung cancer. Cancer directly causes dyspnoea as the disease progresses and affects lung function.\n\nThe relationships are all direct and follow a temporal and causal logic.

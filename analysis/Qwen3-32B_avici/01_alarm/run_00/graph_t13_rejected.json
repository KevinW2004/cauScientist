Given that LVFAILURE is already known to influence STROKEVOLUME, and HYPOVOLEMIA is a competing cause of reduced stroke volume, the current edge HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME is plausible and already present. However, we can explore whether the influence of HYPOVOLEMIA is more directly felt at the level of LVEDVOLUME, which is a key determinant of preload. Since hypovolemia would reduce LVEDVOLUME, it is reasonable to consider adding HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME.

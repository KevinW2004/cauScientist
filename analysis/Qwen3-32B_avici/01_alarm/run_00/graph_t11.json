However, the causal flow may not fully capture the interplay between hypovolemia and downstream hemodynamic variables like CVP. While we previously attempted to add HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192CVP, it failed. A better approach is to explore a more plausible and direct edge involving HYPOVOLEMIA that aligns with domain knowledge, such as its influence on STROKEVOLUME, as hypovolemia reduces preload and thus stroke volume.

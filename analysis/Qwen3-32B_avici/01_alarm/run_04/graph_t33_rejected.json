While prior attempts to add HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 STROKEVOLUME were rejected, this may reflect a constraint in the system rather than a flaw in the hypothesis. We should attempt a more strategic addition by first evaluating if HYPOVOLEMIA has a causal influence on LVEDVOLUME, which is a known determinant of stroke volume. Adding HYPOVOLEMIA \u2192 LVEDVOLUME would provide a more indirect but still physiologically sound path to influence STROKEVOLUME and CO.

Focus on direct causal relationships, temporal ordering, and plausible mechanisms.\n3. **Strategic Selection**: Choose operations (ADD, DELETE, REVERSE) that you believe will most likely improve the graph's log-likelihood and accurately represent the system.\n4. **Update Dossier**: \n   - Add relationships you are now SURE about to \"confirmed_edges\" (format: \"A -> B\").\n   - For relationships you are still UNCERTAIN about, do NOT delete them. Instead, add a note to \"edge_notes\" explaining what you need to test next.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f EXCLUDED Operations (previously failed, don't try again):\nADD: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME, HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192LVEDVOLUME; REVERSE: HYPOVOLEMIA\u2192STROKEVOLUME, LVFAILURE\u2192STROKEVOLUME, LVEDVOLUME\u2192PCWP, LVFAILURE\u2192STROKEVOLUME, LVFAILURE\u2192STROKEVOLUME, LVFAILURE\u2192STROKEVOLUME, LVEDVOLUME\u2192PCWP, LVFAILURE\u2192STROKEVOLUME, LVEDVOLUME\u2192PCWP, LVEDVOLUME\u2192PCWP\n\n========================================\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n========================================\n- Propose at most 1 operations.\n- Output ONLY valid JSON.\n\nInstructions:\n**THINK FIRST**: Before proposing operations:\n1.
